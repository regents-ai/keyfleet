defmodule Keyfleet.Atlas do
  @moduledoc """
  The fleet's work over time, from the whole swarm down to one thing: every
  change to an item of the workspace and every notebook made or saved,
  counted as it happens into buckets of time, and read at three levels.

  ## What is counted

  A change is one touch of one thing at one time, as one Key or as nobody's
  (`Keyfleet.Atlas.Count`): an item made or patched in the graph, counted as
  its page is copied (`Keyfleet.Graph.Projection`, with `Keyfleet.Atlas.Fill`
  counting what came before), and a notebook made or saved, counted as the
  fleet's hub is read each hour (`Keyfleet.Atlas.ReadHub`). A thing's
  `kind` is its item type (goal, task, finding and the rest) or `"notebook"`
  (`Keyfleet.Atlas.Source`); its project is the one it is in.

  Buckets are calendar periods in UTC (`Keyfleet.Atlas.Span`): an hour, a day,
  a week from Monday, a month and a year. Every change is added to its bucket
  of every span, so a read of a span is a read of that span's own rows and
  never sums finer ones: the things changed in a day and the Keys at work in
  a week are counted exactly, which no sum of hours could give.

  ## The three levels

    1. `swarm/5`: for each bucket of a span in a stretch of time, the changes,
       the things changed and the Keys at work, per project and kind, or
       summed over either (`by:`). At most 1,000 buckets a read. Each answer
       is `%{at, project, kind, changes, things, actors}`.

    2. `most_active/4`: the things of one window (the bucket of a span that
       holds `at`) with the most changes first, then the most Keys, a page at
       a time (keyset, `after:`).

    3. `newest_things/4`: the things of one window, the one changed last
       first, a page at a time.

  Both of the last two answer `Keyfleet.Atlas.Thing`s, each with `thing`
  (the item's or notebook's id), `kind`, `project`, `changes` and `actors` in
  the window, `last_at` and `last_key` (its last change and as which Key),
  and, loaded on request, `title` and `space` (the notebook's space in the
  hub, which its link opens in). Each narrows to `source:` (graph or
  notebook), `project:` and `kind:`.

  All three are read as the fleet's workspace is: by its members only
  (`Keyfleet.Access.Check`). Everything else here is the system's.
