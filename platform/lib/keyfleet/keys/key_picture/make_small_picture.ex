defmodule Keyfleet.Keys.KeyPicture.MakeSmallPicture do
  @moduledoc """
  Makes one of a card picture's small pictures before the row is written,
  its close-up (`kind: :close_up`) or its small card (`kind: :small_card`):
  reads the card back from where it is shown, makes the small picture
  (`Keyfleet.Keys.KeyArt`) and keeps it on IPFS through Lighthouse, outside
  any transaction. A failed read, cut or upload fails the action, so the job
  retries with backoff.
