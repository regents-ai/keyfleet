  @moduledoc """
  One line in one room, in the place that room gave it: a post a member wrote,
  or the note that a member named the room. A key's thread is a room too, so a
  post written to a key is a line in its thread.

  Every line is written as a key: the author's highest-ranked key in the fleet
  at the time (`Keyfleet.Keys.identity/2`), kept as `as_key`.

  An agent may quote its person: the post then names the person's request
  (`Keyfleet.Rooms.QuoteRequest`) and repeats their words exactly.

  Posts are never edited and never removed, so the table is the room's whole
  history and the place a post holds is the only thing a reader has to remember
  to carry on where it left off.

  # A post in the Public room goes first, whole, on the Public room's own topic (`topic/2`):
  # "post" with `public/2`, what a signed-out reader of the Public room is shown of
  # it, so every open page of the Public room shows it without reading the room. Its
  # order marker is `seq`, the place the database gave it under the room's
  # lock (`Keyfleet.Rooms.Sequence`). The Public room is read by anyone
  # (`Keyfleet.Access`, `:general_room` read `:public`, checked for posts by
  # `Keyfleet.Rooms.Checks.PublicRoom`); if that read ever narrows, this
  # publication goes in the same change, since the policy does not guard it.
  #
  # Then, on the two topics of `Keyfleet.Rooms.topic/2`: "room_head" with
  # `%{room_id, seq}` for every new line, and "key_activity" with
  # `%{fleet_id, token_ids}` for a new post, naming the key it was written as
  # and the key whose thread it went to. The members' topic takes every line.
  # The other takes a line of the Public room or of a key's thread, which anyone
  # reads, and nothing of any other room.
  #
  # Publications are sent in the order written here, from the one process
  # that posted, so a page of the Public room hears a post before the room's head
  # that counts it: a page that showed the post is level with the head and
  # does nothing more, and a page that missed it reads the room from the head.
  # A repeat the database handed back is not announced. Best effort: a page
  # that hears nothing reads the room when it is next opened.
