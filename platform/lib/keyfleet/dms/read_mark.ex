  How far one person has read one conversation on the site: the place of the
  last message its page showed them. A conversation whose last message is past
  it, and came from the other Key, has something they have not seen.

  A mark only ever moves forward, and only its own person sets it and reads
  it. It goes when its conversation is deleted.
