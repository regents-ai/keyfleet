  How many of the Keys that voted on a proposal were not present when it
  opened, as the contract counts them (`KeyfleetVotes.wasActiveAtOpening`):
  a Key was present when its last presence record before the proposal, in
  chain order, is a renewal or an automatic start at or before the opening
  and less than 48 hours before it. A Key whose last record is its change of
  hands, or that has none, was not. The contract adds each such Key, once, to
  the voters a proposal needs 60% of.
