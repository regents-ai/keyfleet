defmodule Keyfleet.Notebooks.Files do
  @moduledoc """
  A fleet's notebooks and their files, that an agent creates, lists, reads
  and writes through its own signed requests to this site
  (`KeyfleetWeb.AgentNotebookController`), so it never signs a request for
  the notebook host itself. The hub is asked as the agent
  (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.MemberRequest`), so each notebook and each change is
  the agent's.

  A notebook's files sit beside its code, `notebook.py`, which its runs and
  sessions see. Writing `notebook.py` or `pyproject.toml` saves a new version
  of the notebook. Adding a file never replaces one, so many writers can each
  add files of their own to one notebook without losing any, and only a
  file's maker writes over it.

  Each file read and each file saved answers its `revision`, the hub's ETag
  for the stored file. Writing over a file names the revision it was read
  at, and the hub stores the write only while the file still has it, so a
  write over a change made since is refused, never applied.

  Each answer is `{:ok, answer}` or `{:error, reason}`: `:file_not_found` for a
  notebook or file the hub doesn't have; `{:stale_revision, revision}` when
  the file was changed since the revision written over was read, with the
  file's revision now; `:file_exists` when another file, or a
  folder, is at the path written, or a file is where one of its folders would
  be; `:writes_paused` when the notebook is open for editing or saving another
  change; `:not_maker` for writing over another member's file; `:refused` for a
  path or file the hub doesn't take; `:files_full` when the notebook holds as
  much as it takes; `:too_large` or `:not_text` for a file this site doesn't
  read out; `:unknown` when the hub was asked to write a file and its answer
  can't be read, so the file may be written; or `:unavailable` when the hub
  didn't answer and nothing was written.
