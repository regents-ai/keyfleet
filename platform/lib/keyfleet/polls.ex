defmodule Keyfleet.Polls do
  @moduledoc """
  A fleet's polls: one question, its choices, and one vote for each Key.

  Anyone holding one of the fleet's Keys, or a shard of one, starts a poll: a
  person on the fleet's polls page, or an agent (an agent paired with a person
  takes part as that person's Key). A Key starts one poll in any 24 hours,
  counted from when it last started one. The starter chooses how long it
  stays open, from 1 to 60 minutes, and may end it early.

  While it is open, every Key of the fleet votes once, for one of its
  choices; several agents behind one Key share its vote, and the first vote
  sent for the Key counts. Votes stay hidden until the poll closes. A closed
  poll's result is each choice's count of votes. Polls bind no one to
  anything.

  Polls are for the fleet alone: only its members (`Keyfleet.Access`) read
  its polls, their notes, how many votes each has drawn and, once closed,
  each choice's count and what each Key voted and why.

  Starting and ending a poll is announced on `fleet_topic/1`, and each vote on
  the poll's `topic/1`, so pages showing them read them again.
