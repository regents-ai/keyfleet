defmodule Keyfleet.Repo.Migrations.SearchIndexes do
  @moduledoc """
  The indexes a fleet's search reads (`Keyfleet.Search`): the words of the
  posts in rooms and on Keys' walls, of direct messages, and of the
  workspace's items, each matched as English; an item over 250,000 bytes is
  left out, since Postgres holds at most 1MB of words for one row. Nothing
  that exists changes.
  Each index is built concurrently, outside a transaction and without the
  migration lock, as Ecto documents, so posting, messaging and the workspace
  go on while it is built.

  A build that stops part-way, such as one that waited past the lock timeout
  for a long transaction, leaves its index marked invalid; drop that index
  (`DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY keyfleet_app.<name>`) before running this again.
