defmodule Keyfleet.Graph.Event do
  @moduledoc """
  One event of a fleet's graph log, copied at its place (`seq`) in the log.

  Only the events that change the workspace, the attention each write asks
  for and the command record each write leaves are copied; the runtime's own
  bookkeeping is not. Each keeps the projects whose items it touched
  (`projects`), so a member reads one project's changes, and each keeps
  `byte_size`, the length of the event as a reader receives it, so a page of
  events is cut to size by the database. Only the projector writes here. Only
  the fleet's members read its events (`Keyfleet.Graph.Checks.KeyReader`),
  except which of its changes are notable, when, as which Key and in which
  projects, which the workspace pulse shows anyone without any text an event
  holds.
