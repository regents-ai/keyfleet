defmodule Keyfleet.Atlas.Swarm do
  @moduledoc """
  Answers `Keyfleet.Atlas.Thing`'s `swarm` from the buckets
  (`Keyfleet.Atlas.Bucket`): the buckets of `span` that start from `from` up
  to `to`, of `source` and `project` when given, each summed over what `by`
  leaves out, oldest first. Each answer is a map of `at` (the bucket's
  start), `project` and `kind` (nil when `by` leaves it out), `changes`,
  `things` and `actors`.

  Changes and things add up across projects and kinds, as each thing is of
  one project and one kind. Keys do not: one Key at work in two projects is
  one Key across them, so `actors` counts the distinct Keys of the rows
  summed. One statement reads it all, through the buckets' primary key.
