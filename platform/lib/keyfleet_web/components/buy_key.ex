  The "Buy Key" window, the one place a Key is bought. "Buy Key" in the header
  opens it on every page, as do the homepage's two and a fleet page's. Every one
  of them is called "Buy Key": the Key's number and price sit in the facts
  beside it, never in its label.

  It shows Key cards turning over, how many Keys have sold, the Key on offer,
  what it costs (with a tip saying the wallet asks twice) and, once the fleet
  is on Base, its Approve and Buy. They stay
  when the fleet sells out, with why Buy can't be pressed beside it, so a
  buyer keeps the outcome of every purchase they sent. Before then its Buy is closed, with the reason
  right under it, so a phone that scrolls the window sees both together.

  A fleet's sale is read from the one reading of the fleet every open page
  shares (`KeyfleetWeb.FleetNow`), so opening the window costs the page no
  read of its own.
