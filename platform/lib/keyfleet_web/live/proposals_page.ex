defmodule KeyfleetWeb.ProposalsPage do
  @moduledoc """
  What a fleet's proposal pages show, read from the proposals and votes the
  chain reader recorded.

  `list/2` is the fleet's proposals, newest first, twenty to a page.
  `treasury_page/1` is the fleet's Treasury page: how many of its Keys have a
  vote now, its shared money once it is on chain (the latest reading of its
  treasury, its daily split, the advances still out and its latest money in
  and out), the votes carried out lately, and its sales so far.
  `detail/3` is one proposal with its votes, fifty to a page, its calls in
  plain words and exactly as carrying it out sends them, and where it stands as the vote contract says at the latest
  block: its status, the keys counted and each tally, never worked out here.
  Once the fleet is on chain, each carries the network its wallet buttons
  send on; the buttons' steps are built by `Keyfleet.WalletSteps`. A page
  name that is not a proposal number is a page that doesn't exist.

  None of them depends on who is reading, so `first_pages/2` reads the ones
  most visitors open, the first page of the list, the Treasury page and the
  first page of each proposal on that list, once for every open page
  (`KeyfleetWeb.FleetProposals`). The pages further back are read for the
  visit that asks for them.
