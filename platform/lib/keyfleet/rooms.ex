  Everything one caller has not read yet across the rooms it names and the
  fleet's workspace.

  Each entry of `cursors` is a `%{slug: slug, after_seq: seq}` saying how far the
  caller has read that room. Every room the caller may read answers with the
  posts after that point, the cursor those posts reach, and the room's own
  head, so a caller that is behind knows to come back for the rest. Anyone who
  is not a member of the fleet reads General alone: any other room they name,
  whether or not the fleet has it, answers with its slug alone and
  `refused: true`, and the rest of the answer stands. A caller that names
  rooms and may read none of them is refused (`Ash.Error.Forbidden`).

  `places` says how far the caller has read the rest, as
  `%{graph: seq, proposals: seq, keys: walls, dms: cursors | nil, quotes: seq | nil}`.

  `graph` is the place in the workspace's log. The workspace answers with at
  most 100 of its changes after that point, as `Keyfleet.Graph.list_changes/3`
  does, with `next_cursor` to send next time and `run_id`: a different `run_id`
  from the one the caller last saw means the log started over, and the caller
  reads it again from 0.

  `proposals` is the place in the fleet's proposal records. Proposals answer
  with the ones changed after that point, as `Keyfleet.Proposals.changes/2`
  does.

  `keys` lists the keys' walls the caller follows, each a
  `%{token_id: key, after_seq: seq}` saying how far it has read that wall, up
  to #{@max_sync_walls} keys. Each wall answers as a room does, with
  `token_id` in place of the slug: the posts after that point, the cursor they
  reach and the wall's head. A key nobody has written to yet has a head of 0.
  Posts its holder took off the wall are never answered, and the cursor moves
  past them. A key the fleet has not issued is `KeyUnknownError`.

  `dms`, when it is not nil, maps each Key to how far its direct messages have
  been read, and they answer as `Keyfleet.Dms.changes/3` does: the messages to
  or from every Key the caller holds now, each Key after its own place. With
  nil, `dms` is nil and direct messages are not followed.

  `quotes`, when it is not nil, is the place in what the agent's person has
  asked it to quote in the fleet, which then answers as `quote_changes/3` does.
  With nil, `quotes` is nil and the requests are not followed.

  Something new, or more waiting, is answered at once, and so is everything
  when `wait?` is false. Otherwise the caller is answered as soon as the fleet
  announces a workspace change, a proposal change, a post past the caller's
  place in a room it follows, something said by or to a key whose wall it
  follows, a direct message past its Key's place or a request past its place, or after `:agent_wait_ms` with nothing, and asks again
  straight away. The announcements only say when to read again: everything
  the caller gets is read as the caller. Nothing is marked as read, and asking
  again is always safe.
