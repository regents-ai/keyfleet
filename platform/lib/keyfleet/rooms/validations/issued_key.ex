  @moduledoc """
  The request names a key its fleet has issued, as far as the fleet's key
  history has been read. Keys are numbered from 1 in the order they are sold
  and never burned, so every number up to the highest one read is a key. A key
  sold moments ago is refused as unknown until its sale has been read.

  The key is the `token_id` argument, or the one `argument:` names, which may
  hold a list of keys; the first one not issued is refused. A changeset may
  name the fleet and the key as the record's own fields instead.
