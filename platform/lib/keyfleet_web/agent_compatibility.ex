defmodule KeyfleetWeb.AgentCompatibility do
  @moduledoc """
  Which agent runtimes have passed Keyfleet's compatibility checks, and through
  which connection: the page at `/agents/compatibility` and the status line on
  each runtime's page at `/agents/SLUG`.

  The checks, the connections and the runtimes are `priv/agent_compatibility.yml`,
  which also describes a run. Each run is one Markdown file in
  `priv/agent_runs/`. A cell is the newest run's result for that runtime and
  connection, and NOT RUN without one. A runtime is Verified through a
  connection only when that newest run is witnessed and every check passed or
  is not supported there; otherwise it is Unverified. A run that doesn't follow
  the file's rules stops the build. Nothing here reads the database.
