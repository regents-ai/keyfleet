defmodule Keyfleet.Usage.Count do
  @moduledoc """
  Every hour (`config :keyfleet, Oban, cron:`): counts each fleet's usage in
  the month under way and in the month before it (`Keyfleet.Usage.Month`),
  in place of their last counts, then queues a read of each notebook hub
  that counts its fleet's notebook hours (`Keyfleet.Usage.ReadHub`). The
  month before is counted again so the hour between a month's last count and
  its end is never left out, and a run that missed is made up by the next.
  Counting a month again gives the same figures while its records have not
  changed.
