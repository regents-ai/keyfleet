defmodule KeyfleetWeb.WorldlineLive do
  @moduledoc """
  A fleet's Worldline, at `/worldline` under the fleet's address, drawn inside
  the fleet's page under its bar (`KeyfleetWeb.FleetLive`): everything the
  reader may read of the fleet along one line, from its oldest event on the
  left to now on the right (`KeyfleetWeb.WorldlinePage`).

  The picture is drawn in the browser (`assets/js/hooks/worldline.ts`), in
  space: the line runs through time to the sun at now, the workspace, code
  and notebooks are planets orbiting it for ever, each named beside it and
  linked to its place in the workspace (`WorkspacePage.place_path/3`), each
  event of theirs a bead on its planet's path, each room a dithered line of
  a pixel for each post, and everything fleet-wide a point on the line
  itself. While it shows now, the picture flies: the planets circle the line
  far faster than real time, each event turning with its planet's path at
  its own time, slowing while the reader is on one of its events or planets.
  The page sends it the newest events once it is live, older ones as the
  reader moves back to them, and new ones a moment after they happen.
  `?show=list` shows the same events as links, newest first, with "Older"
  for the page before.
  Every event links to the page it happened on.

  `?by=` keeps one Key's events or one wallet's (`WorldlinePage.by/1`), in
  the picture and the list alike; the filter field above them sets it.
