  @moduledoc """
  Whether a task carries everything someone else needs to run its work again
  and compare the result: an exact commit (`commit_ref` ending in a full
  commit hash, never a branch or a short hash) and a `rerun` with its
  command, a lockfile with its digest, a role and digest for each input and
  at least one output with its digest.

  It reads only the task's own fields. It never fetches the commit, a file
  or a digest, and never installs or runs anything: a task that passes is
  complete, not proven to reproduce. That is for a review's `reproduction`
  to say.
