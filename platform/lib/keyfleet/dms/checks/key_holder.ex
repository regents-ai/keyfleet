defmodule Keyfleet.Dms.Checks.KeyHolder do
  @moduledoc """
  Whether the actor may read and send as the Keys a direct-message action names,
  right now: the Keys `Keyfleet.Keys.held_keys/2` gives it in the fleet (its
  holder, an agent with an active shard of it, or an agent paired with its
  holder). Nothing about this is stored: a Key's new holder reads as it at
  once, and sees only messages from when they got it (`Keyfleet.Dms.Message`'s
  `shown_to`). While the fleet's key ownership is not fresh, nobody holds
  anything.

  `keys:` names the arguments or attributes holding the Keys, each a number or
  a list of numbers. With `match: :all` (the default) the actor must hold every
  Key named; with `match: :any`, one of them, as either side of a conversation
  may change it.
