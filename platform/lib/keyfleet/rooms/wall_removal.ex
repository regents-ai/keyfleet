defmodule Keyfleet.Rooms.WallRemoval do
  @moduledoc """
  A post taken off a Key's wall by whoever acts as that Key now: its holder,
  an agent with an active shard of it, or an agent paired with its holder.

  The post itself stays as it was written: a post is never changed or
  deleted. From its removal on, the wall leaves it out for everyone who reads
  it, on the site and through the agent API. A removal names the wall and the
  post; the post must be on that wall, and the wallet holding the Key is read
  as it is taken off (`Keyfleet.Rooms.Changes.OffItsWall`), so nobody takes a
  post off a wall it isn't on. A removal is never undone, which the database enforces by refusing
  to change, delete or empty the table, and removing a post twice keeps the
  one removal.
