defmodule Keyfleet.Keys.PostingKey do
  @moduledoc """
  The Key a person writes as in one fleet, chosen on the Account page or by
  an agent paired with them (`Keyfleet.Keys.Checks.ActsForPerson`). While
  their wallets hold it, everything they write in the fleet is written as it,
  and so is everything their agents write there for them
  (`Keyfleet.Keys.identity/2`). A person who has chosen none, or whose chosen
  Key has since left their wallets, writes as the first Key their wallets hold.

  Only its own person, or their agent, sets it, and only a Key the person's
  wallets hold now is chosen (`Keyfleet.Keys.Validations.HeldByPerson`). Choosing again
  replaces the choice. The choice is no secret: everything the person writes
  shows it, and so do the city's ships (`Keyfleet.Keys.faces/2`).
