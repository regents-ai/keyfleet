defmodule Keyfleet.Dms do
  @moduledoc """
  Direct messages: one Key of a fleet writing privately to another Key of the
  same fleet. A pair of Keys shares one conversation, opened by its first
  message (`Keyfleet.Dms.Conversation`); each message is a line in it
  (`Keyfleet.Dms.Message`), and a Key may block another (`Keyfleet.Dms.Block`).

  Everything belongs to the Keys, never to the people holding them. Who may
  read and send as a Key is decided at each request by who holds it now
  (`Keyfleet.Dms.Checks.KeyHolder`, by the rule `Keyfleet.Keys.held_keys/2`
  shares with rooms): the Key's holder, an agent holding an active shard of it,
  and an agent paired with its holder writing for them. A Key sold takes its
  blocks to the new holder, who sees only messages from when they got the Key:
  every read of messages, conversations and the inbox shows a Key's holder
  only what was sent or received while the Key had its current holder
  (`Keyfleet.Dms.Message`'s `shown_to`). Nothing older is deleted, and the
  other side of each conversation still sees all of it.

  ## The rules

  Sean's four open answers, built with the recommended choice. This is the one
  place they are stated; each names where it lives, so a different answer is a
  small change there.

  1. **Blocks are per Key and follow it when sold.** A block is kept by the
     blocking Key's number (`Keyfleet.Dms.Block`). A blocked Key's messages
     still save, and its conversation shows in the blocker's Blocked inbox
     instead of the main one (`Keyfleet.Dms.Conversation`'s `:inbox` read, its
     `blocked` argument). Catch-up (`changes/3`) leaves out what a blocked Key
     sent (`Keyfleet.Dms.Message`'s `:changes` read).
  2. **Only between Keys of the same fleet.** A conversation and each of its
     messages carry one `fleet_id`, and a send names its fleet once
     (`Keyfleet.Dms.Message`'s `:send` action).
  3. **Deleting is per conversation.** Either side's holder deletes the whole
     conversation for both: its row and every message in it are removed
     (`Keyfleet.Dms.Conversation`'s `:delete`; the messages go with it by their
     foreign key). Either side may set the conversation to remove its messages
     after 1, 7, 30 or 90 days, or keep them (`:set_auto_delete`). A scheduled
     job removes expired messages every hour (`Keyfleet.Dms.Message`'s
     `:remove_expired` and its `oban` schedule).
  4. **No notifications; files only as links.** A new message tells only what
     listens on either Key's inbox (`inbox_topic/2`, `inbox_topics/2`): open
     pages and waiting agents. Nothing else is sent.
     A message carries a file only as a `link` part (`Keyfleet.Dms.Part`). Room
     mutes are unchanged and do not touch DMs; there is no DM mute.

  Also: a Key sends at most 300 messages an hour, and opening a new
  conversation has no daily cap (`Keyfleet.Dms.Changes.LimitSends`, counted
  from the messages it stored).
