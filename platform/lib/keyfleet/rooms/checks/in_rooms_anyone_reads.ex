defmodule Keyfleet.Rooms.Checks.InRoomsAnyoneReads do
  @moduledoc """
  The fleet's rooms anyone reads (`Keyfleet.Rooms.Room.read_by_anyone/0`), the
  Public room and the People and agents room, and the lines written in them,
  for reads that name their fleet and for whoever may read each room
  (`Keyfleet.Access`). A read without a fleet has none.

  For lines, the rooms' ids are found once, in the same statement, so the read
  keeps to its index on the fleet's room and time
  (`messages_fleet_room_lines_index`) rather than joining every line to its
  room.

  With `walls: true`, lines written on the fleet's Keys' walls count too, for
  whoever may read the walls (`:key_walls`), as a fleet's search reads them.
