  Which branches and tags one push moved, read from git's own exchange: the
  commands at the start of the request (`old new ref`, after any `shallow`
  lines, the first carrying the client's capabilities) and the store's report
  of each (`ok ref` or `ng ref reason`), inside side band 1 when the client
  asked for side bands.

  Only a ref the store reported `ok` and that still points at a commit counts:
  a deleted branch moved nothing anyone can read.
