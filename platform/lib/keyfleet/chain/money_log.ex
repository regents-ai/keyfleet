defmodule Keyfleet.Chain.MoneyLog do
  @moduledoc """
  Reads the money logs of a fleet's contracts into the fields of a
  `Keyfleet.Treasury.Event`, each as `{:treasury_event, fields}` with a
  `kind`. Amounts are in the asset's own units, any uint256; ETH is the
  zero address.

  From the fleet contract (`fleet_topics/0`): `ForwardedToTreasury`, an
  asset sent to the fleet by mistake forwarded to its treasury
  (`:forwarded`), and `ProtocolShareSent`, the protocol share deposited in
  REGENT staking (`:protocol_share_sent`).

  From its treasury (`treasury_topics/0`): a proposal's payment (`:paid`),
  advance (`:advanced`), each a share of the treasury's balance of the asset
  in parts per million and the amount it came to, and an advance coming back
  (`:advance_returned`);
  each daily split run (`:daily_split_run`) and what it did with each bound
  asset (`:split_allocated`, `:split_skipped`, `:split_transfer_failed`); a
  new split rate (`:daily_split_rate_set`); OUSD admitted
  (`:ousd_admitted`); the fleet's launch token bound (`:launch_token_bound`);
  and the treasury's own Lit wallet request approved or revoked
  (`:signature_approved`, `:signature_revoked`), by the digest Lit checks.

  From its reward ledger (`rewards_topics/0`): a key's rewards settled to its
  holder (`:settled`) and credit paid out (`:claimed`).

  From the REGENT buyer every fleet shares (`buyer_topics/0`): a piece of the
  fleet's USDC from Key sales turned into REGENT for its treasury
  (`:regent_bought`), the USDC it took, the WETH it went through and the
  REGENT the treasury got (`decode_bought/4`).
