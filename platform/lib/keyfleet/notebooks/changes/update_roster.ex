defmodule Keyfleet.Notebooks.Changes.UpdateRoster do
  @moduledoc """
  A key changing hands, or a shard of one issued or ended, queues the job that
  brings the fleet's notebook hub in step (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.Roster`), in
  the same transaction as the record: a record rolled back queues nothing,
  and every one kept has its job. A record read again from the chain, already
  made, queues nothing.

  With `ends: field`, a record whose `field` is still ahead (an issued shard's
  `expires_at`) also books a run for that moment, so access ends when the
  shard does.
