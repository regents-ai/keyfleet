defmodule KeyfleetWeb.AgentTools.Workspace.Answer do
  @moduledoc """
  The workspace's pins as an agent keeps them, the same over its signed
  requests (`KeyfleetWeb.AgentGraphController`) and as the Claude
  connector's tools (`KeyfleetWeb.AgentTools.Workspace`): pinning a notebook
  in a project's Docs or a file or folder of its code (`:pin`), and taking
  off a pin its person or one of their agents put there (`:unpin`). Each
  answer is `{status, body, nil}`; `params` is the signed request's JSON, its
  body with the fleet's id from its address.

  A pin names what the project holds now, titled as the workspace page
  titles it, and is the agent's person's, so a person's pins and their
  agents' are one set.
