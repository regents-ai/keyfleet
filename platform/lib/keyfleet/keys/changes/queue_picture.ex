defmodule Keyfleet.Keys.Changes.QueuePicture do

  Queues the drawing of a Key's card (`Keyfleet.Keys.DrawPicture`) in the
  transaction of the record that gives the Key its card: a dealt Key's first
  ownership record, or a later Key's reveal. A record read again queues it
  again; the job leaves a card that already has its picture as it is. A Key
  with no card yet, one past the deck awaiting its reveal, queues nothing.
