defmodule Keyfleet.Rooms.Preparations.OneRoom do
  @moduledoc """
  Reads one room's posts, oldest first and never more than the reader asked
  for, whatever a caller tried to add to the query.

  With `in: :room` the room is the fleet's room named by `slug`; with
  `in: :key` it is the thread of the key `token_id`. A room the fleet does not
  have, or a thread nobody has written to yet, reads as a room with nothing
  in it.

  One post more than asked for is read, and left out, so each post answered
  carries `more_after` in its metadata: whether the room has a post after it.
  `Keyfleet.Rooms.more_after?/1` reads it from the last post answered.
