defmodule KeyfleetWeb.AgentTools.Public do
  @moduledoc """
  What anyone reads about the fleets without signing in: every fleet
  (`fleets`), one fleet (`fleet`), an open fleet's latest workspace changes
  (`pulse`), its proposals (`proposals`) and its treasury (`treasury`). They
  have no signed request, so the arguments are their whole check, and each
  answers and refuses as its public address does (`KeyfleetWeb.AgentTools.Run`,
  `KeyfleetWeb.AgentTools.Public.Answer`). The connector lists them for its
  agent with its other tools; nothing here reads as that agent.
