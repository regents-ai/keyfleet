defmodule Keyfleet.Rooms.Changes.LimitQuoteRequests do
  @moduledoc """
  Holds what a person sends their agent from fleets' pages to 300 requests an
  hour across every fleet, counted from the requests stored in the last hour.

  People send from the page, which the API's per-address limit doesn't reach.
  A refused request stores nothing, so it never counts. The count is the
  database's, so every machine sees the same one and a deploy keeps it. It
  runs after `Keyfleet.Rooms.Changes.NextQuotePlace` has taken the person's
  lock in the fleet; two requests at the same moment in two fleets may both
  get through, which a guard against flooding allows.
