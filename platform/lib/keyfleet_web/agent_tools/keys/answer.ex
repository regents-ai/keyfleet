defmodule KeyfleetWeb.AgentTools.Keys.Answer do
  @moduledoc """
  What an agent reads and does about Keys, the same over its signed requests
  and as the Claude connector's tools (`KeyfleetWeb.AgentTools.Keys`): a Key
  as its page shows it (`:show`), the Keys a wallet holds (`:held`), taking a
  post off the wall of a Key it acts
  as (`:wall_remove`), choosing the Key its person writes as (`:post_as`),
  which of its person's agents is on which of their Keys (`:agents`,
  `:assign_agent`), its own mutes (`:mutes`, `:mute`, `:unmute`) and its
  active shards (`:shards`). Each answer is `{status, body, nil}`; `params`
  is the signed request's JSON, its body with the names in its address.

  The page is what anyone reads on the site: who holds the Key and since when,
  the Key its holder writes as, the other Keys they hold, its card's traits,
  its wall and room posts, its votes, and the agents with a shard of it.
  `yours` says whether the agent acts as the Key now (`Keyfleet.Keys.held_keys/2`).

  The person's Keys in a fleet are read as their Account page lists them:
  each Key their wallets hold now with the agents on it, those with agents
  first, then by number, beside the agents paired with them now, and the Key
  the calling agent is on as `yours` (`Keyfleet.Keys.AgentKey`). An agent
  puts an agent that is on no Key onto any of the person's Keys; only the
  person moves or takes off an agent on a Key. A change answers them as they
  are read after it is saved.

  A mute changes nothing for anyone else, and each mute request answers the
  agent's mutes in the fleet as they stand after it. A shard list has one
  shard per Key: the Key it lets the agent act as, until when, whether a vote
  of the fleet has stopped that Key changing the workspace, and the
  transaction that ends the shard, for the agent's own wallet to send when it
  steps down. With no shards, `hint` says how to get one; otherwise it is null.
