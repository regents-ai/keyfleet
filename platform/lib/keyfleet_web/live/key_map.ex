  What a fleet page's key map is told: every key's two marks when it loads,
  and the marks of the keys that have just changed after that.

  A key's marks are whether one of the viewer's wallets holds it and whether
  it has an active shard today. Someone signed out holds nothing. Owners are never
  sent to the map; the map draws every key sold and the rest of the level on
  sale, so how many are sold travels with the marks.

  A search marks the keys it finds: one key by its number, or every key a
  wallet address holds in the fleet now. Who holds each key is on its page and
  in the Member List for anyone to read, so a search tells nobody anything new.
