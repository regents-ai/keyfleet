  @moduledoc """
  The steps of a fleet's money that anyone may press: running the daily
  split, returning an advance, sending the protocol share owed to REGENT
  staking, and turning the USDC from Key sales into REGENT for the treasury.
  `Keyfleet.WalletSteps.Build` describes what every builder answers.

  The daily split's figures are its preview, read at the latest block the
  way the treasury works it out: for each asset it splits, the balance, the
  least it splits from, and what each key would get now.
