defmodule Keyfleet.Atlas.ReadHub do
  @moduledoc """
  Reads the notebooks of each of one fleet's projects from its hub and counts
  what changed into the Atlas, queued every hour by `Keyfleet.Atlas.ReadHubs`.

  A notebook new to the Atlas is counted as made at its `created_at`, and as
  saved at its `updated_at` when that is later; one updated since it was
  last listed is counted as saved at its new `updated_at`. So a notebook
  saved many times in an hour counts as one save that hour, at its last. Each
  is counted as the Key its maker writes as (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.keys/2`) and
  kept (`Keyfleet.Atlas.Notebook`) for the next read to compare with.

  A project is read from an hour before its notebook updated last, so a save
  the last read only just missed is still seen; a project read for the first
  time is read whole. Each project is counted in one transaction that holds
  the project's row, so a project deleted meanwhile is either counted and then
  forgotten whole, or not counted at all. A read that fails stops the run;
  the next hour's read finds everything it would have, from the same place.

  It waits its turn with the other hub calls (the `notebook_hubs` queue runs
  one job), and a fleet's read is queued again only once the last has run.
  Once done it tells the fleet's Atlas readers (`Keyfleet.Atlas.changed/1`).
