defmodule Keyfleet.Usage.Machine do
  @moduledoc """
  One notebook machine the fleet's hub started, as this site last read it from
  the hub's list of machines (`Keyfleet.Usage.ReadHub`): a `:session`
  machine, started for someone to open a notebook, or a `:run` machine,
  started for a notebook's background job. `id` is the hub's session or run
  id, `started_at` and `ended_at` the hub's, `seen_at` the last read that
  listed it.

  A machine counts from `started_at` until `ended_at`, or, while the hub has
  not said it ended, until `seen_at`. One whose end is never seen, because
  its record is gone from the hub before a read sees it end, stops counting
  at its last sighting, so its hours never run past what was seen and can be
  short by up to the hour between reads.

  What is not counted:

    * Machines the hub never lists: one it started that belongs to no
      session or run, a session that never got a machine, and a run that
      never started one.
    * Machines whose whole life falls in a gap in the hub reads longer than
      the hub keeps their record: about a day after a session ends, 30 days
      after a run ends, and at once for a run whose notebook or project is
      deleted. A hub read outage longer than a day so loses the sessions that
      start and end inside it; that is accepted.

  Only the server reads and records them.
