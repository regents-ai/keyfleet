 * The Worldline's shaders, all drawn by vgpu. Into one picture, with
 * premultiplied alpha so the page's own ground shows through: the stars, then
 * the paths (the gold line, each planet's helix around it, and each planet's
 * circle in the plane of the present), then the marks (every event, and the
 * sun and planets at now). The paths and marks place every point by the same
 * sums as scene.ts, through the same camera matrix. Then a bloom: what is
 * bright in the picture is taken at half size, blurred across and down, and
 * laid back under the picture as a glow.
 *
 * The paths and marks are drawn more than once, told which part by `SIDE`:
 * the helices' far halves and the marks behind the line first, then the line,
 * veiled in the page's ground so what passes behind it is hidden, then the
 * near halves and the marks in front of it, and the heads last of all.
