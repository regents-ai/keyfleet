defmodule Keyfleet.Proposals.Calculations.KeyBallots do
  @moduledoc """
  Each Key's vote on a proposal, as lists of token ids in order: `yes`, `no`
  and `abstain` hold the Keys whose latest vote, in chain order, is that
  choice, as `Keyfleet.Proposals.Calculations.LatestVotes` counts them; a Key
  may vote again and only its latest vote counts. `silent` holds the Keys
  present when the proposal opened that have not voted, which the contract
  counts against approval.

  A Key was present when it opened by the rule
  `Keyfleet.Proposals.Calculations.LateKeys` applies
  (`KeyfleetVotes.wasActiveAtOpening`): its last presence record before the
  proposal is a renewal or an automatic start at or before the opening and
  less than 48 hours before it. Ash takes a fragment's SQL only as written, so
  the two modules each spell the rule out, and a change to it changes both.
