defmodule KeyFleet.Repo.Migrations.FixedOpenAndCreatedRooms do
  @moduledoc """
  Replaces level rooms with each fleet's fixed, open and created rooms: drops
  the level column and its checks, adds an open room's topic with who named it
  and when, and marks each line in a room as a post or a naming. No two rooms
  of a fleet may go by the same name, whatever its case: a room goes by its
  topic once it has one, and by its name otherwise.

  Generated with `mix ash.codegen`, then edited by hand so that the rooms and
  posts already there are kept: every post so far is a post, a room at one of
  the new fixed or open addresses becomes that room, and every other room,
  including the old planning, work and level rooms, becomes a created room.
  Rolling back does the reverse.
