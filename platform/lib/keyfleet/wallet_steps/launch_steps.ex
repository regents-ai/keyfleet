defmodule Keyfleet.WalletSteps.LaunchSteps do
  @moduledoc """
  The upkeep of a fleet's token launch through Autolaunch, which anyone may
  press once the sale has ended: settling the sale, adding the launched token
  to the daily split, releasing the launch's tokens set aside for the
  treasury, and collecting the pool's fees. `Keyfleet.WalletSteps.Build`
  describes what every builder answers.

  The launch is the one the treasury has added to the daily split, or before
  that, the latest launch a carried-out proposal made: the one its
  transaction's receipt names, made by and for the fleet's own treasury.
