defmodule Keyfleet.Keys.DeckEndCheck do
  @moduledoc """
  Every hour (`config :keyfleet, Oban, cron:`): saves with the site's errors
  (`Keyfleet.Keys.DeckEndingError`) each deployed fleet that has sold at least
  100 fewer Keys than its deck holds and no more than the deck, when it can
  sell Keys past its deck. Classic #1 is named from its 900th Key until its
  1,000th; its 1,001st is the first to draw its card with Chainlink
  randomness, so the Regents Safe readies the randomness subscription in that
  window (`docs/deployment.md`).

  It is one error naming every such fleet, saved again every hour while any
  fleet is in its window. A fleet whose supply is its deck, as the Regents
  Club's is, never draws and is never named.
