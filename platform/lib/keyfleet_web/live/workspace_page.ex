defmodule KeyfleetWeb.WorkspacePage do
  @moduledoc """
  What a fleet's workspace pages show, read from the workspace's read tables
  alone, never from the fleet's writer.

  `board/3` is one of the workspace's four places (`places/0`), in one of
  the fleet's projects (`Keyfleet.Projects`) or across all of them. Its
  Project is the items a page at a time, the most recently changed first,
  beside the goals and the latest changes; its Docs the newest notebooks;
  its Code the project's repository, its top folder and the changes sent to
  it (`Keyfleet.Code`), or every project's repository in turn. Docs and Code
  each list what the fleet's members pinned there (`Keyfleet.Graph.Pin`).
  Public is what the fleet's Keys made public
  (`Keyfleet.Projects.Publication`), newest first, and anyone reads it.
  `item/4` is one item with its fields, its links a page at a time and its
  history a page at a time, and a goal with the work around it in place of
  its links. Goals are listed one line each,
  the board's and every list of goals. Each answers
  `seen`, the log and the place in it the read tables had reached when the
  page was read. Every change is told as one plain line: a list of parts, each a piece of text, a key
  (`{:key, token_id, agent}`, with the name of the agent that wrote as it, or
  nil) or an item (`{:item, id, title}`, with a `nil` title when the item is
  not in the workspace). Who added an item is a key told the same way, so two
  agents writing as one person's key are told apart; a starting goal, one of
  the ideas every workspace begins with (`Keyfleet.GoalIdeas`), was added by
  Keyfleet.

  `commit/4` is one commit in one of the fleet's repositories, at the
  address a workspace cites it by (`commit_url/3`): who sent it, and the evidence that cites it
  with the tasks that produced that evidence.

  Only the fleet's members read its workspace
  (`Keyfleet.Graph.Checks.KeyReader`) and its code: for anyone else every page
  answers `members_only?: true`, with what the fleet shows anyone of its
  workspace: each project by title with the titles of its open goals
  (`KeyfleetWeb.FleetPage.read_trying_now/1`), and nothing else members
  write, except the Public place, which reads the same for everyone.

  A page name that is not one the tables can answer, such as an unknown type
  or a damaged page position, is a page that doesn't exist.

  One folder or file of a project's repository as it stands on the default

  first, or a file's text, beside the latest changes sent to the repository.
  A visitor reads a commit the Key holding the project made public, read-only,

  `file_max_bytes`, is named but not shown; `listing` is `:unreadable`
