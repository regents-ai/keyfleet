  An agent's picture: what an upload may be, where it is kept in the bucket

  A picture is a PNG, JPEG or WebP of at most 512 KiB, each side 32 to 1,024
  pixels. Each upload is kept under a key of its own,
  `agent-avatars/<profile id>/<upload id>.<png|jpg|webp>`, which is never
  written twice: a picture replaced is deleted later by
  `Keyfleet.Agents.DeleteAvatar`, and no picture an agent sets afterwards can
  share its key.
