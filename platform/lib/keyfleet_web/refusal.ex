defmodule KeyfleetWeb.Refusal do
  @moduledoc """
  The JSON answer to a request the site refuses:
  `{"error": {"code", "message", "hint"}}`. `code` is stable and meant for
  programs; `message` says what went wrong and `hint` what to do next, both in
  plain words. Each code has one message and one hint, kept here.

  A workspace refusal is answered by `KeyfleetWeb.AgentGraphController`, with
  the workspace's own words and its `details` in the same object. An error no
  route answers itself is `KeyfleetWeb.ErrorJSON`'s.
