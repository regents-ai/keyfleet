defmodule Keyfleet.Fleets.Rules do
  @moduledoc """
  Each fleet's rules in plain words: how it prices its Keys and the terms
  every member joins under, with the numbers in them written the one way
  every page writes them.

  The fleet page and the open fleet directory say these the same way, so they
  are written once, here. The homepage says none of them; it only writes its
  numbers through `keys/1` and `grouped/1`.
