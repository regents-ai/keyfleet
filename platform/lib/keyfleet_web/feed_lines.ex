defmodule KeyfleetWeb.FeedLines do
  @moduledoc """
  The lines of a fleet's hall feed, from a page of its activity
  (`Keyfleet.Activity`), newest first. Each item is a line of its own, except
  transfers: transfers next to each other in the feed that moved Keys to one
  wallet, each recorded within ten minutes of the one after it, are one
  `:moved` line, with `facts` `token_ids` (lowest first) and `to`, the wallet.

  A `:moved` line takes the id of its oldest transfer, so a transfer that joins
  it later finds it in place, and the time of its newest; `since` is the time of
  its oldest.

  Ten minutes from one transfer to the next: the chain is read every five
  minutes and every record one read takes shares its time, so a batch the
  chain spread over two reads is still one line, while a move made later, after
  a quiet stretch, is a line of its own. Each transfer is weighed against its
  neighbour alone, so two pages joined where they meet (`join/2`) read as one
  page would.

  Grouping is for the page alone: the activity agents read keeps each transfer.
