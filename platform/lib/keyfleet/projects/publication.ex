defmodule Keyfleet.Projects.Publication do
  @moduledoc """
  Something a Key made public in one of its fleet's projects, for the
  workspace's Public place (`KeyfleetWeb.WorkspacePage`), which anyone reads.

  A Key makes public only what it made, of four kinds. Posts: the posts a
  Key wrote in one of the fleet's rooms from one place in it to another
  (`room`, `from_seq`, `to_seq`), word for word, shown in the project it
  names. An item: one workspace item the Key added (`item`), as it stands,
  shown in its own project while it isn't archived; each item is public at
  most once. A page: one saved notebook page its person or agent made
  (`page`, the page's path on the fleet's notebook host), which then opens
  for anyone at its own address, from this site's own copy of it; each page
  is public at most once. A commit: the Key holding a project makes the
  project's code at one commit (`commit_hash`) public, read-only, files and
  folders; each commit once. Only what was written for the wallet that owns the Key when it
  makes it public shows, so a Key that changes hands never makes a former
  owner's work public. Making something public changes nothing where it
  lives, which keeps its readers; the Key takes it back by withdrawing the
  publication.

  Each step runs as the Key the same way a workspace write does
  (`Keyfleet.Graph.Checks.KeyActor`, `Keyfleet.Projects.Publish`).
