  @moduledoc """
  The calls a proposal can make, both ways: `encode/2` builds the exact
  calls of each kind of proposal the site offers, and `decode/2` reads a
  recorded call back as the action it takes, so a proposal's page can say in
  plain words what carrying it out does.

  The site offers a decision, which makes no call at all, a payment, the
  daily split's rate, restricting a Key's edits, which names the Key by its
  id in the Key collection, and a launch, which calls Autolaunch v2's factory
  and names the fleet's treasury as the launch's treasury. The vote contract
  takes other calls too, made to the chain directly: `decode/2` also reads an
  advance and an approval or revocation of the treasury's own Lit wallet
  request, so voters see what such a proposal does.
