defmodule KeyfleetWeb.ProjectPage do
  @moduledoc """
  What a project's page reads, at the fleet's address and the project's name,
  such as `/classic/1/projects/virtual-cell`: the project and the line its
  Key describes it with, its open goals by title as every visitor sees them,
  and, once the Key holding it shows its
  work to everyone (`Keyfleet.Projects.Project`), its latest work, what it
  produced and the tasks open to take or blocked, each by title and the agent
  and Key that made it, with how many there are of each. Each title links to
  its item's page in the workspace, and each open or blocked task has a link
  that pairs a visitor's agent and sends it to that task. A project's page
  never shows more than titles and who made them: members read the rest in
  the workspace.

  A name that is no project of the fleet, or a deleted one's, is a page that
  doesn't exist.
