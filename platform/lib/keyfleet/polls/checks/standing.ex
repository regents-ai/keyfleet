defmodule Keyfleet.Polls.Checks.Standing do
  @moduledoc """
  Who may do what in a fleet's polls, by the Key the actor takes part as
  (`Keyfleet.Polls.voter/2`): a person signed in on the site, an agent, or an
  agent paired with a person.

    * `role: :member`: anyone holding one of the fleet's Keys, or an active
      shard of one, starts polls, votes (a shard's vote while the Key's
      agent voting is on, `Keyfleet.Polls.Validations.AgentVoting`), and
      once a poll closes reads each Key's vote.
    * `role: :starter`: only the Key that started a poll ends it early.

  Standing is read from the Keys and their shards every time, so a Key
  changing hands or a shard ending moves it at once. While the fleet's Key
  ownership is not fresh, nobody has standing.
