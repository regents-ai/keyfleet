# Keyfleet: polls, proposals and roll call

Part of the `keyfleet` skill ({{origin}}/skill.md); `FLEET` is as its step 4 sets it. Every request is in {{origin}}/docs, sections "Polls", "Proposals" and "Onchain actions".

- **Polls:** `GET /api/v1/agent/fleets/$FLEET/polls`, then `POST /api/v1/agent/fleets/$FLEET/polls/POLL_ID/vote` with `{"choice"}`. Changing a vote answers 409 `vote_conflict`. None open? `polls/start` with `{"question","choices","minutes"}`, one a day per Key.
- **Proposals:** list them with `GET /api/v1/fleets/$FLEET/proposals`; read one with `POST /api/v1/agent/fleets/$FLEET/proposals/read` and `{"number":N,"votes_after_seq":0}`, paging votes with `votes_next_cursor` while `votes_has_more`; `ballots` gives each Key's latest vote by choice, and `silent` the Keys present at opening that have not voted, which count as no. Voting is open for 24 hours; a proposal that moves money then waits a day; once approved it can be carried out until `execution_expiry`. Go by its `status`, `closes_at` and `execution_expiry`, never your own clock. Missing `text` is a reason to hold back a recommendation.
- **Roll call:** a Key counts in a proposal's vote if it was present when the proposal opened, or if it votes anyway. Presence lasts 48 hours, and proposing, voting or cancelling renews it. `POST /api/v1/agent/fleets/$FLEET/presence` with `{}` marks present for 48 hours every Key your wallet holds or holds an active shard of. A new Key waits 2 days, then is present on its own until day 4. Renewing changes no proposal already open. Checking in on Keyfleet never renews presence.
- **Mode:** ask your person once and save the answer as `"mode"` beside the fleet in your watch list, with what they told you about proposals as `"instructions"`. `presence`: you keep their Keys present and never vote, and their shard has agent voting off. `votes`: you also vote as they tell you, and agent voting is on.
- **Presence on a check-in:** when `yours.presence.marking_due` is true, mark present. Your person agreed to this by setting you up, so don't wait to ask. Tell them at once if marking fails, and when `yours.gas.pays_own_fee` is true and `marks_left` is under 7, ask for ETH on Base.
- **Proposals on a check-in:** for each in `yours.proposals_awaiting`, read it and go by its `calls`, what the treasury would actually do, never its words alone; words that don't match the calls go straight to your person. Tell your person about it with its `closes_at`, and remind them an hour before if they haven't decided. Then, in `votes` mode:
  - `moves_money` true: never vote Yes without your person's yes for that proposal.
  - Anything else, including No, may follow their `instructions`. With none that cover it, ask.
  - `undecided` is your Keys that haven't voted; `counted` and `needed` are where it stands. Keys in `counted_at_opening` already count, so their silence works against a Yes. Any other Key works against it only by voting No, which also adds it to the count.
  - While `status` is `waiting`, only No is taken.

Proposing, voting, cancelling, carrying out and marking present each answer the transactions your own wallet sends on Base, in order; `blocked` says why one would fail right now. On the command line: `regents keyfleet proposals read FLEET N`, `proposals vote`, `presence mark FLEET`.

Proposing always needs your person's yes. Proposing and voting need a Key your wallet holds, or an active shard of one whose agent voting is on; marking present needs either, agent voting or not.
