defmodule Keyfleet.Decks do
  @moduledoc """
  A fleet's card deck: a fixed list of cards made before the fleet is created,
  whose hash the fleet's record on chain keeps for good. A card is a seed; a
  key dealt card `i` shows the traits `Keyfleet.Traits.draw/2` gives that seed
  from the deck's trait table, under the key's own top line.

  A deck is the JSON file named by its hash, lowercase, in the release's
  `priv/decks`; the tests keep theirs elsewhere with
  `config :keyfleet, Keyfleet.Decks, directory: ...`. It names the fleet it was
  made for, the hash of the trait table its cards draw from, and the cards,
  each a `0x` 32-byte lowercase hex seed, numbered from 0 in the order listed:

      {"fleet": "CLASSIC #1", "table": "0xa0a1…64fe", "cards": ["0x…", ...]}

  A deck is used only when `keccak256` of the file's bytes, exactly as they
  are, is the hash asked for, its table hash and every card are 32 bytes of
  lowercase hex, and it has at least one card. Anything else raises. A deck
  that passed is kept for the life of the node.

  their reveals were logged on chain (block number, then log index). Seeds
  past `size` are left out; those keys draw their own card.

  Every card starts in the remaining list, `0` to `size - 1` in order. For
  each seed, read as a 256-bit unsigned number, the card dealt is the one at
  `seed mod (cards remaining)` in that list; the list's last card then takes
