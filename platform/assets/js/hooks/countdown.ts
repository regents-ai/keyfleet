/**
 * The time something open has left, such as a poll or a proposal's vote, or
 * the time until something starts, such as a new Key's share of the Treasury
 * slice, written again as it changes. The page sends the closing time and its own
 * clock as it read it (`data-closes-at`, `data-now`), so a phone whose clock
 * is wrong still counts down to the right moment. The words match what the
 * page writes (`KeyfleetWeb.Components.Countdown`), so nothing jumps as the
 * hook takes over.
 *
 * It only writes words, once a second at most, and never moves anything, so
 * a reader who asked for less motion sees the same as everyone. A clock's
 * countdown (`seconds`) says "Closing…" when the time runs out and waits;
 * the page itself draws what closed a moment later. A `clock` writes hours,
 * minutes and seconds after its lead words, then its own words once it runs out.
