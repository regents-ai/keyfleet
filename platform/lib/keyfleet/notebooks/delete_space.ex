defmodule Keyfleet.Notebooks.DeleteSpace do
  @moduledoc """
  Deletes a deleted project's space, with its notebooks, from its fleet's
  notebook hub: the space the project recorded, and any the provisioner made
  for it and tagged `keyfleet/<project name>` (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.Space`).
  Queued in the transaction that deletes the project
  (`Keyfleet.Projects.Changes.Forget`), once per project. It runs on the
  `notebook_hubs` queue, one run at a time, so a space still being made
  when the project was deleted is made first and found here by its tag. A
  space already gone counts as deleted, so a run that fails part way is
  simply run again. A hub that does not answer is waited for first
  (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.HubClient.wait_while_away/2`).
