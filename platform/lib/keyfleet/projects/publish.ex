defmodule Keyfleet.Projects.Publish do
  @moduledoc """
  Makes something public as one of the fleet's Keys, and takes it back
  (`Keyfleet.Projects.Publication`). The actor acts as the Key the same way a
  workspace write does (`Keyfleet.Graph.Checks.KeyActor`).

  Posts are made public into an active project of the fleet, from one of the
  fleet's rooms (never a Key's thread), over a range of at most
  `Publication.most_posts/0` places that holds at least one post written as
  the Key for the wallet that owns it today, so a Key that changes hands
  never makes a former owner's posts public. A post is written for the owner
  when the owner's wallet wrote it, or a wallet the owner gave a shard of the
  Key: an agent writes as the Key with its own wallet.

  An item is made public into its own project, which is active, while it
  isn't archived, when the Key added it in the ownership it is in today,
  whoever wrote for the Key; each item once. A saved notebook page is made
  public, once, by the person or agent that made it (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.Makers`)
  acting as the Key, into the project whose notebook made it, which is
  active, once this site keeps its own copy of the page. A project's code at
  one commit is made public by the Key holding the project, which is active,
  once the code store has that commit; each commit once. Only the Key that
  made something public takes it back. A refusal says why in words
  (`Keyfleet.Projects.Errors.PublishError`).

  The room is read as the site reads it, whoever may read it: what is shown
  is what the Key chose to show, and only the posts written as that Key.
