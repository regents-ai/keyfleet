defmodule Keyfleet.Notebooks.Roster do
  @moduledoc """
  Brings one fleet's notebook hub in step with who holds the fleet's keys now.

  Any of the fleet's projects still without a space in the hub gets the job
  that makes one (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.Space`), which runs this again once the
  space is made. Its first request makes this site's provisioner the hub's
  first user.

  Then everyone who holds one of the fleet's keys, an agent with an active
  shard of one, or an agent paired with a person who holds one, is an editor
  of every space the fleet's projects have; anyone else this site added
  loses their place in each, their open notebook connections close, and they
  are suspended in that hub, so nothing they hold there still lets them in.
  Someone who holds a key again is let back in.

  It runs whenever a key changes hands or a shard is issued or ended, and
  again when an issued shard runs out (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.Changes.UpdateRoster`),
  and for every fleet every ten minutes (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.Reconcile`). Every step is safe to repeat, and a
  run that fails part way is run again from the start. While the fleet's key
  ownership is still being read, it waits.

  Runs go one at a time (the `notebook_hubs` queue runs one job). One run per
  fleet waits to start at a time; a change made while one runs queues the
  next, so the last run always reads the latest owners. A run booked for when
  a shard runs out doesn't count as waiting, so it never holds back a run
  wanted now.
