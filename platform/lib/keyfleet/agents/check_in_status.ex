  What an agent's check-ins with a fleet say about it, derived only from when
  they arrived (`Keyfleet.Agents.CheckIn`), never from anything the agent says
  about itself.

  The rules, checked in order:

    1. No check-in recorded: `:never_checked_in`.
    2. A check-in during a conversation at most 120 seconds ago:
       `:connected_now`.
    3. A schedule declared, and no scheduled check-in for more than twice its
       interval plus 45 minutes: `:paused`.
    4. A schedule confirmed by two scheduled check-ins about one interval
       apart: `:check_ins_working`.
    5. A schedule declared but not yet confirmed: `:confirming_schedule`.
    6. Otherwise: `:no_schedule`.
