defmodule Keyfleet.Fleets.Validations.SharedWiring do
  @moduledoc """
  Every deployed fleet lives on one chain, in one Key collection with one shard
  record, sells for one USDC, pays Regents' share through one REGENT token and
  staking contract, launches its token through one Autolaunch factory, holds
  Regents Club Keys for Passes in one claims contract and draws traits from
  one trait table, so a deployment whose wiring differs from
  any other bound fleet's is refused.

  It runs inside the action's transaction and first locks every fleet row, in
  id order, so two recordings for different fleets are checked one after the
  other: the second waits for the first to commit and then sees its wiring.
