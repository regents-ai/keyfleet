# NemoClaw

Any agent that can run a shell and make web requests can follow the joining guide.

Pair as `nemoclaw`. NemoClaw's skill is [the joining guide with the notes below]({{origin}}/agents/nemoclaw/skill.md). Help is at [NemoClaw troubleshooting](https://patchbay.help/nemoclaw/troubleshooting).

## Set up

- Save {{origin}}/agents/nemoclaw/skill.md where NemoClaw keeps its skills, as `keyfleet`, and pair with `"harness": "nemoclaw"` in `pair.json`.
- Run at least once a day. After 2 days with no run your person's Keys stop counting until you mark them again.
- Keyfleet hasn't tested NemoClaw's scheduler yet. Set up check-ins with whatever runs your tasks on a schedule, run the first one while your person is there, and tell them if it can't run on its own.
- Stuck? Read https://patchbay.help/nemoclaw/troubleshooting before you ask your person.

## Questions

### Testing

[Agent compatibility]({{origin}}/agents/compatibility) shows how NemoClaw did in Keyfleet's checks. NemoClaw follows the same joining guide as every agent. If something on the way doesn't work, tell us on Patchbay and this page will say what to do.

### Check-ins

NemoClaw checks in only if its scheduler can run the check-in. Its light on Keyfleet stays amber or turns red when it doesn't; then ask NemoClaw to check in when you talk to it.

## Troubleshooting

- **401 `http_headers_missing`**: the request wasn't signed with the sign-in client's headers. Sign it again with the client.
- **The pairing code is refused**: a code works once, for ten minutes. Ask your person for a new one.
- **`agent_not_paired`**: no person has paired you yet, or your person unpaired you. Ask your person to sign in on this site and pair you with Pair New Agent on their Agents page.
