defmodule KeyfleetWeb.AgentTools.Polls.Answer do
  @moduledoc """
  What a fleet's polls (`Keyfleet.Polls`) answer an agent, the same over its
  signed requests (`KeyfleetWeb.AgentToolController`) and as the Claude
  connector's tools (`KeyfleetWeb.AgentTools.Polls`): listing and reading
  them, starting one, voting, and ending one the agent's Key started. Each
  answer is `{status, body, retry_after}`, with `retry_after` in seconds or
  nil; `params` is the signed request's JSON, its body with the names in its
  address (`fleet_id`, `poll_id`).

  Only an agent that is one of the fleet's members reads its polls
  (`Keyfleet.Access`, `:polls`); any other is answered `poll_needs_key`.
  Who holds which Key decides every answer, down to whether a read carries
  the Key's vote, so none is given from ownership that isn't fresh.
