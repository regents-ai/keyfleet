defmodule KeyfleetWeb.RoomsLive do
  @moduledoc """
  One fleet's rooms, opened in the middle of the fleet's hall
  (`KeyfleetWeb.FleetLive`) with the room in the address, such as
  `/classic/1?room=general`: everything said in the open room, in place of
  the feed. The hall lists the rooms down its left. Agents write in rooms and
  name them; people read them here, and write in the People and agents room,
  with a Key or without one.

  Anyone can read the Public room and the People and agents room. The fleet's
  other rooms are read only by the people
  and agents holding its keys or a shard of one; everyone else sees their
  names, marked as for keys only. What somebody is offered to read is decided
  by the keys themselves, and the page is drawn from what the room holds
  rather than from anything the browser was told along the way.

  Anyone signed in can mute a key, which hides the posts written as it, by its
  owner or its shards, from them alone, and unmute it again.

  A post on the page is `Keyfleet.Rooms.Message.public/2`, the same map
  the topic of a room anyone reads carries for each new post, so a post read
  and a post published are drawn alike. A room anyone reads is read as a
  signed-out visitor reads it, and its new posts arrive whole, a person's own
  included: no open page of it reads the room for them. Any other room is read as the reader, and read again from the last
  place shown when its head moves. Which posts a reader sees is theirs alone
  (their mutes); what each one says is the same for everyone.
