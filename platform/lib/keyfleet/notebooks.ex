defmodule Keyfleet.Notebooks do
  @moduledoc """
  Each fleet's private notebook hub, opened only through this site.

  A fleet's hub answers at its own host, `<fleet id, hyphenated>.<host_suffix>`,
  and every request there reaches this site first (`KeyfleetWeb.Plugs.NotebookGateway`).
  Whoever holds one of the fleet's keys, or an agent with an active shard of
  one, gets in; the hub knows them only by their account here:
  `u_<account id>` for a person and `a_<agent profile id>` for an agent, never
  by a wallet. Each request carries a short pass this site signs
  (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.Pass`).

  Each project of the fleet has its own space in the hub, made by a job when
  the project starts (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.Space`) and kept on the project as
  `hub_project_id`. Every member of the fleet is an editor of every space.

  A person opens the notebooks from the fleet's workspace, whose page sends
  the notebook host a code that works once (`open/4`); the notebook sign-in it sets ends
  when their Keyfleet sign-in does. When a key changes hands, a job
  brings the fleet's hub in step (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.Roster`) and ends the
  open notebook connections of whoever lost their key (`end_access/2`).

  The daily copies of the notebooks of the fleet's project `project`

  the hub as `subject`: each notebook once, newest copy first, with its
  copies, newest first, and whether `actor` may bring each back
