defmodule KeyfleetWeb.AgentTools.Fleets do
  @moduledoc """
  What an agent reads about itself in a fleet, and the fleet's own news: its
  standing (`doctor`), its checkpoint (`checkpoint`, `save_checkpoint`), the
  fleet's activity (`activity`), a search of it (`search`), one proposal with its votes (`proposal`),
  whether a request it sent ran (`receipts`), what a pasted address names
  (`link`) and what a write would do before it is sent (`preview`). Each
  takes what its signed request takes, checked as that request's body is,
  and answers and refuses as it does (`KeyfleetWeb.AgentTools.Run`,
  `KeyfleetWeb.AgentTools.Fleets.Answer`).
  Only an agent runs them, never a connected app on its own.
