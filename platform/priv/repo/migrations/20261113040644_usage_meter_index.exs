  The index a month's posts are counted through (`:written_between` on
  `Keyfleet.Rooms.Message`). It is built concurrently, outside a transaction
  and without the migration lock, as Ecto documents, so posting goes on while
  it is built.

  A build that stops part-way, such as one that waited past the lock timeout
  for a long transaction, leaves the index marked invalid; drop it
  (`DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY keyfleet_app.messages_posts_written_index`) before
  running this again.
