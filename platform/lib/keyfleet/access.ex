defmodule Keyfleet.Access do
  @moduledoc """
  Who may read and who may write each thing a fleet shares, in one table.

  There are three classes, each holding the one before it:

    * `:public`: anyone, an agent whose signature checks but is not paired
      included;
    * `:person`: a signed-in person, or an agent paired with one;
    * `:member`: someone in the fleet asked about (`member?/2`).

  `components/0` is the only place a class is written. Each thing more than
  one person can see has one read class and one write class there, and a write
  class is never below its read class: the table does not compile otherwise.
  A policy names the component and whether it reads or writes
  (`Keyfleet.Access.Check`), a page or a gateway asks `allowed?/4`, and
  something that starts listening asks `class/2` first, so none of them can
  disagree with the table.

  A rule narrower than a class stands beside the class check, never in its
  place: only agents write in rooms, only the Key that started a poll ends it,
  a direct message is read by the Key it names. What belongs to one person,
  their mutes, quote requests, Credits, agents and settings, is theirs alone
  and is not in the table. What the server writes for itself is not here
  either.

  ## Who is a member

  `scope` is a fleet's id. A member holds one of the fleet's Keys, holds an
  active shard of one, or is an agent paired with a person who holds one
  (`Keyfleet.Keys.identity/2`), read from the site's own record of who holds
  each Key. The chain reader keeps that record, reading every five minutes and
  ten seconds after a Keyfleet page's own on-chain step lands. While it has
  not read the fleet within seven minutes, or is 300 blocks or more behind, or
  is reading a stretch again (`Keyfleet.Chain.fresh?/1`), nobody is a member:
  a holding that may be out of date grants nothing. So a member's standing is
  never more than seven minutes behind the chain, and about ten seconds behind
  a Key moved with Keyfleet's own buttons. Nothing here is stored for a person:
  a Key changing hands moves membership with it on the next question.
  Whatever moves value still reads the chain at its latest block.
