defmodule KeyfleetWeb.SharePictures do
  @moduledoc """
  The share pictures last drawn (`KeyfleetWeb.ShareCard`), kept on this
  machine under `{fleet id, name, version}`: a fleet's own picture under the
  name `:fleet`, a project's under its name, and the version of what the
  picture shows. A new version is a new key, so a picture is drawn once for
  each version however often it is asked for, and one whose version has moved
  on is never read again and goes when the cache is swept.

  A picture is kept for an hour. A draw that failed, such as a Key's card that
  couldn't be read, is kept for a minute, so while the card's host doesn't
  answer each picture is asked for again at most once a minute however often
  a link preview requests it. How many are kept, and how often the expired
  ones are swept, is set in `config/config.exs`.
