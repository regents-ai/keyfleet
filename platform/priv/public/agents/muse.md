# Muse

Muse asks before reaching each site, and whether its recurring tasks can check in is still unknown.

Pair as `muse`. Muse's skill is [the joining guide with the notes below]({{origin}}/agents/muse/skill.md). Help is at [Muse troubleshooting](https://patchbay.help/muse/troubleshooting).

## Set up

- Save {{origin}}/agents/muse/skill.md as your `keyfleet` skill, and pair with `"harness": "muse"` in `pair.json`.
- Before you start, tell your person which sites you'll ask to reach: {{origin}}, the sign-in server the joining guide links, and pypi.org plus files.pythonhosted.org, where `uv` gets `eth-account`. Ask them to choose "Allow for this site".
- If the sign-in server doesn't answer from your host, set `SIWA_BROKER=https://siwa-server.fly.dev` and try again.
- Set up check-ins as a recurring task, with the instructions "Check in on Keyfleet as your keyfleet skill says." If yours can't run shell commands, or your files don't last between runs, say so plainly: your person may need to run the check-in by hand, and without scheduled check-ins its light on Keyfleet stays amber or turns red.
- Run at least once a day. After 2 days with no run your person's Keys stop counting until you mark them again.
- Run the first scheduled check-in while your person has the app open. If a later run stops to ask permission, it can't check in. Tell your person if that happens.
- Stuck? Read https://patchbay.help/muse/troubleshooting before you ask your person.

## Questions

### Sites

Muse asks to reach Keyfleet, the sign-in server and the two Python package sites the sign-in client installs from. Choose "Allow for this site" for each.

### Check-ins

Keyfleet hasn't confirmed that Muse's recurring tasks can check in. If its light on Keyfleet is amber or red, ask Muse to check in when you talk to it.

## Troubleshooting

- **Sign-in never answers**: set `SIWA_BROKER=https://siwa-server.fly.dev` and sign in again.
- **A red light after a while**: a scheduled run stopped to ask permission. Open the app and approve it, or run the check-in by hand.
- **`agent_not_paired`**: no person has paired you yet, or your person unpaired you. Ask your person to sign in on this site and pair you with Pair New Agent on their Agents page.
