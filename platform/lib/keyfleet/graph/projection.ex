defmodule Keyfleet.Graph.Projection do
  @moduledoc """
  Copies a fleet's graph log into the read tables, page by page, from where
  its cursor stands.

  Each page is one database transaction: its events, the objects and links
  they change, and the cursor moved past the page commit together, so a copy that stops part way resumes at the first page
  it had not finished. The cursor moves on only from where the page found
  it, so when two copies run at once, the page of the one that is behind
  rolls back instead of moving the cursor backwards. The cursor moves past
  every event it reads, including the runtime's own bookkeeping, which is
  not copied.

  Each event keeps the projects whose items it touched. A page skips every
  event that touches an item of a deleted project, or one already gone from
  the read tables, and everything such an event would change: a project
  deleted while its last writes were on their way never comes back. Each
  page holds the fleet's cursor from its start, as a project's deletion does
  (`Keyfleet.Projects.Changes.Forget`), so the two take turns.

  Each page counts the changes it copies into the Atlas in the same
  transaction (`Keyfleet.Atlas.Count.copied/4`).

  The log names itself with `run_id`, minted when its file was created. A
  cursor from another log, or one past the log's head, was copied from a log
  that is no longer this fleet's: the fleet's read tables and its counted
  graph work in the Atlas are removed and copied again from the beginning.
