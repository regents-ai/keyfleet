defmodule Keyfleet.WalletSteps.VoteSteps do
  @moduledoc """
  The steps of a fleet's vote: casting ballots, proposing, cancelling and
  carrying a proposal out. `Keyfleet.WalletSteps.Build` describes what every
  builder answers.

  A ballot is cast with every key the signer may vote: those it holds, and
  those it holds an active shard of while the key's agent voting is on, less
  any sold under two days ago, which the vote contract refuses. While a
  proposal that moves money waits its day after closing, the one ballot the
  vote contract takes is No. A
  proposal is made with one key, and its calls come from the kind of proposal
  chosen (`Keyfleet.Proposals.Actions`). Pages name Keys by their number in
  the fleet; every step names them by their id in the Key collection.
