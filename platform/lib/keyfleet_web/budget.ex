  Fits a read's answer into the bytes its caller can take (`max_bytes`),

  answer gives, so reading on from that cursor brings it.

  Posts and changes are kept in order, each part's from its start, and a
  part stops at the first that doesn't fit, so its cursor is the place of
  the last one kept. The bytes counted are the answer's JSON, with room to
  spare for each cursor that moves.
