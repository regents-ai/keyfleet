defmodule Keyfleet.Atlas.Count do
  @moduledoc """
  Counts changes into the Atlas: each change, a touch of one thing at one
  time as one Key (or as nobody's Key), is added to that thing's row and to
  its project's and kind's bucket in every span (`Keyfleet.Atlas.Span`).

  A thing's row counts its changes and Keys and keeps its last change; a
  bucket counts the changes, the things new to it, which a row of the same
  span and start not there before says, and the Keys. Counting only ever
  adds, so a change must be counted once: the graph's changes are counted as
  far as the fleet's cursor says (`counted_seq` of `Keyfleet.Graph.Cursor`),
  by the page that copies them or by `Keyfleet.Atlas.Fill`, both holding the
  cursor, and a notebook's as `Keyfleet.Atlas.ReadHub` first sees each save,
  one fleet at a time. Graph changes and notebooks are counted into rows of
  their own kinds, so no two writers ever add to the same row at once, and a
  bucket's things are never counted twice.
