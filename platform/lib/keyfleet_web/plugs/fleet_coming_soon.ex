defmodule KeyfleetWeb.Plugs.FleetComingSoon do
  @moduledoc """
  Answers every agent request about a coming-soon fleet with 404
  `fleet_coming_soon`. Such a fleet has no rooms, workspace or proposals and
  no keys to run until it opens, so nothing the request asks for is read or
  written, a sync's check-in included. Requests that name no fleet, and those
  about open or unknown fleets, pass on unchanged. The Claude connector's
  tools refuse it alike (`KeyfleetWeb.AgentTools.SignedRequest`,
  `KeyfleetWeb.ToolErrors`).
