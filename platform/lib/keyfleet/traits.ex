defmodule Keyfleet.Traits do
  @moduledoc """
  Every revealed key's traits, drawn from its seed and the trait table by the
  rule in `contracts/README.md`.

  A fleet's table is the JSON file named by its trait table hash, lowercase,
  in the release's `priv/trait_tables`, such as
  `priv/trait_tables/0x1249…8610.json`; the tests keep theirs elsewhere with
  `config :keyfleet, Keyfleet.Traits, directory: ...`. It is an object whose
  `traits` lists each trait in the order the draw takes them, with its `name`
  and its `values`, each a `name` and a whole-number `weight`:

      {"traits": [{"name": "Hull", "values": [{"name": "Brass", "weight": 50}, ...]}, ...]}

  A table is used only when `keccak256` of the file's bytes, exactly as they
  are, is the fleet's trait table hash, and each trait's weights add up to at
  least 1 and less than 2^32. Anything else raises. A table that passed is
  kept for the life of the node.
