defmodule Keyfleet.Notebooks.MarkSucceeded do
  @moduledoc """
  Marks the copies of one fleet's run pages kept before each copy recorded
  whether its run succeeded (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.SavedOutput`): every such
  copy of a run the fleet's hub names succeeded, so a notebook's last good
  page is there from the day the record starts. It only ever sets
  `succeeded` from false to true on those copies, and changes and deletes
  nothing else. A copy of a run the hub no longer holds (it keeps runs 30
  days) stays as it was.

  Queued once for each fleet with a notebook hub by `backfill/0`, run by
  hand on the release that adds `succeeded`. It reads only the notebooks
  with such copies, in the fleet's projects, waits its turn with the other
  hub calls (the `notebook_hubs` queue runs one job), and a fleet's job is
  queued again only once the last has run. One that stops part way is run
  again from the start: marking a copy twice changes nothing.
