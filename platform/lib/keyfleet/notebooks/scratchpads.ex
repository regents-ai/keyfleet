defmodule Keyfleet.Notebooks.Scratchpads do
  @moduledoc """
  Gives every Key of a fleet its own notebook, "Key N", in the fleet's shared
  `scratchpad` project, kept as that Key's (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.Setting`):
  whoever acts as the Key is its creator, and it stays with the Key's number
  when the Key changes hands. Every member of the fleet reads it.

  Each roster run queues it (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.Roster`), so a Key sold, a
  scratchpad space just made or a scratchpad deleted gets its notebook within
  ten minutes: a kept scratchpad the hub no longer has is forgotten first. The hub makes each notebook as this site's provisioner, tagged
  `keyfleet/key-<N>`: a run that made one and stopped before keeping it finds
  it again by that tag, so a Key never gets two. Runs go one at a time on the
  `notebook_hubs` queue, and one run per fleet waits at a time.
