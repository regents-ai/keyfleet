defmodule Keyfleet.Agents.AgentProfile do
  @moduledoc """
  A stable product identity for one verified SIWA wallet.

  Each verified request from the agent saves what the SIWA service says about
  it: its page in the agent registry, and the World ID person behind it with
  that person's agent count (`RegentAgents.HumanBacking`). The first person
  saved stays for good: a later request naming nobody, or someone else, leaves
  them, and one naming them again updates their count. Pages show what was
  saved. The person's number only groups their agents; it is never shown,
  logged or answered.
