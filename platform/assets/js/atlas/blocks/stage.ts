/**
 * The Atlas as blocks: a treemap of the window shown. Each project is a block
 * as big as the work it holds in the window, tinted along the page's scale
 * by how recently it was worked on, with a dot on a block changed today.
 * Zooming into a block, or choosing it, opens it in place: it grows to fill
 * the stage while a block for each kind of work fades in inside it, then a
 * block for each thing, as big as its changes, the quieter ones gathered
 * into one more block, never bigger than a third of the things beside it,
 * that opens the same way, then the thing itself, its name a link to its
 * page. The path above the picture goes back up.
 *
 * Nothing the fleet did reaches the browser at once. The page answers for
 * the window's counts by project and kind (`atlas_blocks_fleet`), and for a
 * kind's things a hundred at a time (`atlas_blocks_things`), asked for only
 * as a kind or the rest of one grows toward filling the stage. When the
 * fleet's work is counted again the page says so (`changed`), and the counts
 * and the things on screen are read again in place.
 *
 * The blocks hold still: each keeps its place in the order it was first
 * seen, the busiest first, with newcomers after, and new counts ease every
 * block to its new size where it stands. The wheel and a pinch zoom about the
 * pointer and dragging moves. With the keyboard, the arrow keys move a ring
 * between neighbouring blocks, Enter opens the block ringed (and a thing's
 * page once it fills the stage), Escape goes back up and plus and minus zoom
 * about the ring. Choosing a thing in the strip beside the picture opens the
 * blocks down to it.
 *
 * The block pointed at, or ringed, stands out while the others quieten, and
 * a card beside it, never over it, says what it holds; the card's close
 * button or Escape puts it away until another block is chosen.
 *
 * The blocks are drawn on the GPU (`./renderer`) and only redrawn when
 * something moved; their names are the page's own, from a pool, shown only
 * where every word fits (measured, never cut short). Moves run under 300 ms
 * with anime.js, and at once after a key press or for a reader who asked for
 * less motion.
