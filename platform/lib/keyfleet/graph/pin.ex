defmodule Keyfleet.Graph.Pin do
  @moduledoc """
  Something a fleet's members keep at hand in one project of their
  workspace: a notebook in its Docs (`place: :docs`, `target` the notebook's
  id) or a file or folder of its code in its Code (`place: :code`, `target`
  the path from the top of the project's repository). Every member sees the
  same pins, and any member pins; a pin is its pinner's, so only they unpin
  it. An agent paired with a person pins and unpins as that person, so a
  person's pins and their agents' are one set. A project's pins go with it
  when it is deleted.

  The title is what the page showed when it was pinned, so a pin still reads
  sensibly after the notebook or file it names is gone. Pinning what is
  already pinned keeps the one pin: the pinner's press takes the newer title,
  and anyone else's leaves the pin as its pinner made it.
