/**
 * A fleet's Worldline (`KeyfleetWeb.WorldlineLive`) in three dimensions: the
 * gold line runs through time with the sun at now, and Workspace, Code and
 * Notebooks orbit it as planets, each event a bead on its planet's helix, a
 * pixel on its room's line or a point on the line itself
 * (`../worldline/scene`).
 *
 * The page sends the newest events once it is live (`worldline:page`), older
 * ones as the reader moves back to them (the reply to `worldline_older`), and
 * new ones a moment after they happen (`worldline:heard`): the sun, or the
 * planet the event belongs to, flares, and a word for it shows over the sun.
 *
 * Dragging turns the picture; it turns on a little when let go and springs
 * back from either end of its turn, and a double-click or Reset turns it
 * back. Scrolling, or dragging with Shift held, moves through time; a pinch,
 * or scrolling with Ctrl or ⌘ held, zooms toward the time under the pointer,
 * and minus and plus zoom too. A scroll on past now, or back past the oldest
 * event, or one that began on the page, scrolls the page. On a phone a
 * sideways swipe moves through time and an upward one scrolls the page; a
 * pinch zooms and a twist of two fingers turns it. The arrow keys move
 * through time and with Alt turn it; plus and minus zoom. One real link
 * follows the mark pointed at, tapped or nearest the middle while the
 * picture has the keyboard, so it opens as any link does, in a new tab too;
 * a drag never opens it.
 *
 * The sun and each planet at now carry their names beside them, clear of
 * each other and inside the picture (`tips` in the scene). Each planet's
 * name and a ring on the planet are one real link to its place in the
 * workspace, the stops for Tab after the mark's link; pointed at or given
 * the keyboard, the planet stands out as a mark does, and a press on it that
 * drags turns the picture instead. Now only names the sun.
 *
 * While it follows now, the picture flies: the planets circle the line far
 * faster than real time, each helix turning about the line with its planet
 * and each bead on it keeping its place at its own time, and the stars drift
 * by, the nearer faster. Only real time moves anything along the line: the
 * sun moves on and new events arrive at theirs. On a mark or a planet the
 * flight eases to a twentieth of its pace, so what is there can be read and
 * pressed: while the mouse is on it, a finger is down on it, it has the
 * keyboard, or a mark's link shows from a tap. Anywhere else on the picture
 * it flies on at full pace. Moved through time, the picture eases to a stop
 * and the orbits hold where they stand, so no bead jumps; Now flies on again
 * from there, and Reset returns to the view it opens on.
 *
 * The picture is drawn only with WebGPU. Without it the line and the sun the
 * page drew stay, with a note that the List has every event. For a reader who
 * asked for less motion nothing flies, shimmers, glides, reveals or flares,
 * and a turn stops where it is let go; the picture and its links still work.
 *
 * anime.js moves every transition, by the values the GPU reads rather than
 * by the page: the first reveal (a timeline: the line and helices draw out
 * to the sun, passing each event in turn, then the planets come out onto
 * their orbits), the flight's pace, the glides of Now, Reset and the zoom
 * buttons, the mark in focus, the planet pointed at, an arrival's flare and
 * word, and a change of filter. A move asked for from the keyboard happens
 * at once. The shimmer runs by the clock.
