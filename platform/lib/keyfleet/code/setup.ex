  Makes one project's repository in the code store and records it
  (`Keyfleet.Code.Repository`). Queued when the project starts
  (`Keyfleet.Code.Changes.MakeRepository`), and again by an ask for a
  repository not made yet (`queue/1`, from `Keyfleet.Code.owner/1`). Making it
  again finds the one already made, so a run that fails part way is simply
  run again. A failed run tries again a minute later, up to `max_attempts` runs.
  A setup that gave up is queued again by the next ask, and that is saved
  with the site's errors (`Keyfleet.Code.StoreDownError`).
