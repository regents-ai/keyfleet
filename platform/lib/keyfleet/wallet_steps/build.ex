defmodule Keyfleet.WalletSteps.Build do
  @moduledoc """
  Builds the steps one wallet button group sends, for one signer, as a
  `RegentChain.Review`: every step's contract and calldata, encoded here and
  never in a page.

  The answer is `%{review: review, figures: figures, problem: problem}`.
  `figures` are what the steps were built from, for the page to show beside
  the buttons. When what was typed can't be put into a call, or the chain
  can't be read, the review has no steps and `problem` names why; otherwise
  `problem` is nil. Vote, Mark present and Claim all are an exception: when
  the chain doesn't answer whether Keys reached the signer since the reader's
  last block (`own_keys/3`), their steps are still built, with the Keys known,
  and `problem` is `:unread`. Asking again for a Key's draw and ending its
  wait are another: their calls need nothing from the chain, so when it
  doesn't answer they are still built, and `problem` is `:unread`.

  `figures.blocked` names each step the chain's own state, read at the latest
  block, makes certain to fail, with why: `%{"claim-0x…" => :nothing_to_claim}`.
  Its button stays in view, can't be pressed, says why in a few words, and
  comes back when a later build no longer names it. Every flow's transactions
  are also named `:no_eth_for_gas` here, in one place, when the signer pays
  its own network fee and holds less ETH than any transaction costs
  (`Keyfleet.WalletSteps.Reads.short_of_gas?/2`), unless `sending` is false:
  the steps then only show the figures of a wallet no press is sent from, so
  its ETH says nothing about a press. Nothing else holds a press
  back: a pending transaction, a repeat press, or one that only might be
  refused always reaches the wallet, and the contract decides.

  Each group's steps are built by one of `Keyfleet.WalletSteps.KeySteps`,
  `Keyfleet.WalletSteps.VoteSteps`, `Keyfleet.WalletSteps.MoneySteps` and
  `Keyfleet.WalletSteps.LaunchSteps`, each of which answers `{:ok, steps,
  figures}`, `{:ok, steps, figures, problem}` or `{:problem, problem,
  figures}`. Key sales need a fleet the site has recorded as deployed, which
  is how they stay off: no fleet is recorded on Base yet.
