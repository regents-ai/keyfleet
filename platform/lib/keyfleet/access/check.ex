defmodule Keyfleet.Access.Check do
  @moduledoc """
  The one policy check for what a fleet shares: whether the actor may read or
  write a component of `Keyfleet.Access`, in the scope the action names.

      authorize_if {Keyfleet.Access.Check, read: :rooms, scope: :fleet_id}
      authorize_if {Keyfleet.Access.Check, write: :key_walls, scope: :fleet_id}

  `scope:` names the argument or attribute that holds the fleet's id. The
  policy names the component, never a class: the class is looked up in the
  table. A request that reads its class once hands it on in its context
  (`Keyfleet.Access.context/3`), and it is not read again here.
