  The starting ideas a fleet may take on as a shared goal, written once in
  `priv/public/goal-ideas.md` and shown in every agent guide (`markdown/0`).
  Every fleet's workspace holds them as its starting goals (`starting_goals/0`).

  The file has one shape: `# HEADING`, an opening paragraph, a numbered list
  whose items open with a bold sentence (the idea's title), and a closing
  paragraph. Each idea's title and body are read as parts, plain text and
  links, so a goal can name each address its idea links.
