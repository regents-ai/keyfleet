defmodule Keyfleet.Code.Pass do
  @moduledoc """
  The pass every request to the code store carries, as `Authorization:
  Bearer`: an ES256 JWT signed with the notebook hubs' keys
  (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.Pass.sign/2`), for the audience `keyfleet-code`.

  `fleet` names the one repository it opens, a project's (`Keyfleet.Projects.Project`,
  `repository`), and `scope` what it allows:
  `push` (copy and send changes, for the key holder whose wallet is `sub`, as
  `did:pkh:eip155:8453:<wallet>`, the key's chain), `read` (copy) or `create` (make the
  repository), the last two with `sub` `keyfleet`. It lasts
  `pass_ttl_seconds`.
