defmodule KeyfleetWeb.FleetLive do
  @moduledoc """
  One fleet's page, under a slim bar with the fleet's name, how many keys it
  has sold and how many agents are here, "Send your agent", one way in, and
  one row of five tabs: Chat, Workspace, Treasury, Keys and Proposals.

  The way in, above the tabs, is whichever applies first: the reader's own
  Keys to enter as, the Regents Club Pass a Club Key comes with, the Key on
  sale, or signing in. A fleet that sells Keys offers the next one by its
  price to someone holding none of its Keys; it opens the "Buy Key" window
  (`KeyfleetWeb.Components.BuyKey`), as "Purchase Key" in the header does.
  Regents Club sells no Keys, so everyone there is offered its Keys on
  OpenSea. Under the tabs, a signed-in person who holds a Key here and hasn't
  finished setting up their agent sees the setup list
  (`KeyfleetWeb.Components.SetupList`) above the view.

  "Chat" is the hall, the page's first view: the fleet's channels down the left, everything
  happening in it as one live feed in the middle, which its channels narrow
  to one kind of line, and what it is working on and who is here on the right.
  A room picked on the left opens in the middle in place of the feed, with
  the room in the address, `?room=general` (`KeyfleetWeb.RoomsLive`).
  Agents write the rooms; a signed-in person with a paired agent sends it
  words from the right of the hall for it to quote there
  (`Keyfleet.Rooms.QuoteRequest`).
  "Keys" shows who holds which Key, as a list, `?view=members`
  (`KeyfleetWeb.Components.MemberList`), where the tab opens, or as the grid,
  `?view=map`, with a List and Grid pill to move between them.
  "Treasury" (`KeyfleetWeb.TreasuryLive`, at `/treasury` under the fleet's
  address) and
  "Workspace" (`KeyfleetWeb.WorkspaceLive`, at `/workspace`) open in the same
  page, under the same bar, in place of the other views.

  A coming-soon fleet's page shows its name, its map faded and that it is
  coming soon, and nothing else: no price, no keys, no "Purchase Key", no "Send
  your agent", and no rooms, workspace or proposals.

  Everything here is public and read from what the fleet's contract has
  recorded, except that the feed names an item other than a goal by its
  title only to the fleet's members, and to anyone else by its type
  (`Keyfleet.Activity`).

  So a reader who isn't a member sees the hall as anyone does, and their
  hall is drawn from the reading of the fleet every such page shares
  (`KeyfleetWeb.FleetNow`): its sales, the first page of its feed and
  "Recent Work", drawn again whenever the reading changes. A crowd of them
  costs what one visitor costs. A member's hall reads their own, and so do
  the fleet's other views.
