  Runs an agent tool's action as the calling agent, as the signed request of
  its browser tool (`tool:`) would run: the action's input becomes that
  request's JSON, with any `fixed:` fields the browser tool always sends; its
  body is checked as the request's is; and the resource's `Answer` module
  (`KeyfleetWeb.AgentTools.Rooms.Answer` for `KeyfleetWeb.AgentTools.Rooms`)
  answers the action's name as it answers the request. Waits for news are
  counted under the `waiter` its caller puts in the action's context.
