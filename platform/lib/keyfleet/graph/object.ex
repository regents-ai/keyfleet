defmodule Keyfleet.Graph.Object do
  @moduledoc """
  One workspace object as the fleet's graph log last left it: its member
  fields (`data`), its server-owned fields (`sys`), its version and the
  project it belongs to (`Keyfleet.Projects`), copied from `sys` so a project's
  objects are read by index.

  A task marked done has been submitted for review, and its `review` says
  where that stands: `awaiting_review` until a review of the task's current
  version has been recorded, then `disputed` if any review of that version
  disputes it, `reproduced` if one accepting it says the reviewer ran the
  work again from its commit and it reproduced, otherwise `accepted`. Any
  change to the task makes a new version, which waits for review again. A
  task not submitted has no `review`, whatever its author says it ran: its
  `progress` is all Keyfleet knows of it.

  An object last changed where its creation or its latest patch (an archive
  included) stands in the log: `changed_seq` is that event's place and
  `changed_at` its time. Nothing else moves them: linking the object,
  unlinking it, or a notice that it needs attention leaves them as they were.

  Only the projector writes here. Only the fleet's members read its objects
  (`Keyfleet.Graph.Checks.KeyReader`), except through the one read a fleet
  shows anyone: its open goals, each by title and project alone
  (`Keyfleet.Graph.shown/1`).
