defmodule Keyfleet.Projects.Project do
  @moduledoc """
  One project inside a fleet: its name, which addresses use and which never
  changes, its title, which pages show, the Key that holds it (`key`, by
  number) and its state: `active`, `archived` or `deleted`.

  A Key holds at most one active project and five archived ones. It starts a
  project when it holds no active one (`start`), archives its active one
  (`archive`), takes over any archived project when it holds no active one
  (`take_over`), and deletes one of its own archived projects (`delete`):
  the row stays, marked deleted, so its name and repository name are never
  used again, and everything else of it goes (`Keyfleet.Projects.Hold`).
  Projects stay with the Key's number when the Key changes hands. Only an
  active project takes new work.

  Its repository in the code store is named when the project starts: the
  fleet's own name for `general`, which keeps the fleet's first repository,
  and `<fleet id>-<name>` for every other. Fleet ids hold no hyphen, so no two
  projects of any fleets share a repository name; a job queued as the
  project starts makes it there (`Keyfleet.Code.Setup`). `hub_project_id` is its
  space in the fleet's notebook hub, once a job has made it
  (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.Space`).

  Every fleet has `general`, archived and held by Key 3 (Key 329 in Regents
  Club, `general_key/1`), which holds the starting goals, the fleet's first
  notebook space and its first repository (`bootstrap_general`). No Key ever
  deletes it (`Keyfleet.Projects.Validations.NotGeneral`).

  The Key holding a project chooses whether its page shows anyone its work
  (`show`, `shown_to_everyone`): its goals, its latest work, what it produced
  and the tasks open to take or blocked, each by title. It starts shown to
  members only. The Key also gives it a one-line `description` (`describe`),
  which its page shows under the title and shares as its description.

  Every fleet also has shared projects, active and held by no Key
  (`shared`, `shared_names/1`): `understanding`, the fleet's notes on how its
  members work together, and, in every fleet but Regents Club, `scratchpad`,
  where each Key has a notebook of its own (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.Scratchpads`).
  No Key archives, takes over or deletes one, and none counts as a Key's
  active project. A shared project the fleet no longer shares is deleted
  (`unshared`, `Keyfleet.Projects.unshare!/1`).
