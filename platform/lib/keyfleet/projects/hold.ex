defmodule Keyfleet.Projects.Hold do
  @moduledoc """
  Starts, archives, takes over and deletes a project as one of the fleet's
  Keys, shows its page's work to everyone or to members only, and describes
  it (`Keyfleet.Projects.Project`). The actor acts as the Key the same way
  a workspace write does (`Keyfleet.Graph.Checks.KeyActor`), read in the
  one transaction in which the step is checked against the projects the Key
  holds and made, an agent's pairing held until it commits. A refusal says
  why in words that name the project (`Keyfleet.Projects.Errors.HoldError`).

  The database keeps each rule even when two steps run at once: one active
  project per Key is a unique index, and each change of state is made only
  from the state it was checked in, so of two steps on one project the
  second finds it changed and is refused. A second start or take-over the
  index refuses, from a double press, is told as the check tells it
  (`active_held`), in the index's own words.

  A project the whole fleet shares, held by no Key, is never archived, taken
  over, deleted, shown to everyone or described: no Key holds it as its
  active project, and it is never archived.

  Once a delete is kept, everyone's admission to the fleet's notebooks ends,
  so their next request is let in to the spaces left, without the deleted
  project's.
