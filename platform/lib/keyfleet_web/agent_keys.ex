defmodule KeyfleetWeb.AgentKeys do
  @moduledoc """
  The Keys a person's agents act for, as the Agents page shows them beside
  each agent (`KeyfleetWeb.AgentsPanel`) and once an agent pairs
  (`KeyfleetWeb.PairingBox`): the Key the person put each agent on in a fleet
  (`Keyfleet.Keys.AgentKey`) while it stands there
  (`Keyfleet.Keys.placed_on?/3`), and each Key the agent's wallet holds an
  active shard of, each linked to its page. For an
  agent with neither whose person holds a Key, the page links to Your Keys on
  the Account page (`assign_path/0`), where the person puts it on one. An
  agent with neither whose person holds no Key has nothing there.

  Shards and holders are public, as the chain records them; which agent is on
  which Key is read for the signed-in person alone. A failed read comes back
  as `{:error, failure}` (`KeyfleetWeb.PageRead`), so the page says so rather
  than crashing.
