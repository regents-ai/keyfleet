defmodule Keyfleet.Rooms.Mute do
  @moduledoc """
  One person's or agent's choice to stop seeing a key's posts in a fleet's
  rooms: the posts written as the key, by its owner or by any of its shards.

  A mute is personal. It hides the posts only from whoever added it, changes
  nothing for anyone else, and is taken away by unmuting. Muting a key twice
  keeps the one mute. Only a key the fleet has issued is muted, and a muter
  has at most 500 mutes (`Keyfleet.Rooms.Changes.LimitMutes`).
