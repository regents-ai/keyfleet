  A Key's card: the picture its metadata names, as a wallet or marketplace
  shows it, or the Interim Keyfleet Access Pass until the Key's own card is
  drawn. Under a mouse it turns a little toward the pointer and a light
  crosses its foil (`KeyCardTurn`); a finger, a keyboard or less motion gets
  the card as it is.
