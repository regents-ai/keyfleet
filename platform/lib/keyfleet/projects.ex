defmodule Keyfleet.Projects do
  @moduledoc """
  The projects inside each fleet. A project gives one piece of the fleet's
  work its own board, its own space in the fleet's notebook hub and its own
  repository in the code store. Every fleet has `general`, archived and held
  by Key 3 (Key 329 in Regents Club), which holds the starting goals, the fleet's first notebook space
  and its first repository.

  Every fleet also shares projects that no Key holds, always active:
  `understanding`, the fleet's notes on working together, and, in every fleet
  but Regents Club, the `scratchpad`, with a notebook for each Key
  (`bootstrap_shared!/1`).

  Every other project is held by one of the fleet's Keys and is active, archived or
  deleted. A Key holds at most one active project and five archived ones; it
  starts, archives, takes over and deletes them as `Keyfleet.Projects.Project`
  says. New work goes into any active project, whoever holds it; an archived
  one takes no writes until a Key takes it over.

  Every member of the fleet sees every project that is not deleted and works
  in any active one: membership is the fleet's, never a project's. Visitors
  see each project's title and the titles of the goals inside it, and
  nothing else of the workspace, unless the Key holding a project shows its
  page's work to everyone.

  A Key also makes public what it made (`Keyfleet.Projects.Publication`), for
  the workspace's Public place, which anyone reads.

  Acting as a Key is the same rule as every workspace write
  (`Keyfleet.Graph.Checks.KeyActor`). A project is never renamed or moved,
  and a deleted project's name is never used again.
