defmodule KeyfleetWeb.Components.Tour do
  @moduledoc """
  The guided tour of a fleet's page: a ring round one part of the page at a
  time, the rest of the page gently dimmed, and a small card beside the ring
  that says what the part is, with Back, Next and Skip.

  A visitor's tour ends at creating an account and buying a Key. A holder's
  goes on from their Key to pairing an agent, giving it the Keyfleet skill,
  setting its daily run and having it introduce itself. Each plays by itself
  once in a browser, on the fleet's first view, and the Tour button in the
  fleet's bar plays the reader's own again. The tour only points: the dimming
  takes no presses, so Buy Key and every wallet button work while it shows.

  Both lists are drawn here for the browser's `Tour` hook
  (`assets/js/hooks/tour.ts`), which keeps them as they were first drawn: a
  visitor who buys a Key while on the page goes on to the holder's tour
  without the page being drawn again. Nothing about the tour is kept on the
  server. A step names its part as a CSS selector; a step whose part is not on
  the page is left out, and one that names no part shows its card in the
  middle of the screen.
