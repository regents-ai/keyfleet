defmodule KeyfleetWeb.WorldlinePage do
  @moduledoc """
  A fleet's worldline, read: everything that happened in it, as events in
  time order, each linking to the page it happened on. Nothing is stored for
  it; every page is read fresh from the records the fleet already keeps.

  ## Sources

  Each source is read as its own policy lets the reader read it
  (`Keyfleet.Access`):

    * `:posts`: posts and room namings in the rooms the reader reads
      (`Keyfleet.Rooms`). Keys' threads and direct messages are never read.
    * `:changes`: the workspace's notable changes (`Keyfleet.Graph`), for
      whoever reads the workspace.
    * `:pushes`: branches and tags moved in the fleet's code
      (`Keyfleet.Code.Push`), for whoever reads the code.
    * `:notebooks`: notebooks changed, as their daily copies record it
      (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.Backup`), for whoever reads the workspace.
    * `:polls` and `:stopped`: polls started, and stopped as they were
      ended or closed (`Keyfleet.Polls.Poll`), for whoever reads the polls.
    * `:opened` and `:closed`: proposals opened, and closed as their ballots
      stopped (`Keyfleet.Proposals.Proposal`), for anyone.
    * `:votes`, `:executed` and `:cancelled`: votes on proposals, and
      proposals carried out or cancelled (`Keyfleet.Proposals`), for anyone.
    * `:keys`: Keys bought or given, and Keys changing hands
      (`Keyfleet.Keys.KeyAttachment`), for anyone.
    * `:shards`: shards lent and ended (`Keyfleet.Keys.ShardEvent`), for
      anyone.
    * `:present`: Keys marked present on their own (`Keyfleet.Keys.Presence`),
      for anyone.
    * `:treasury`: the daily split released and rewards claimed
      (`Keyfleet.Treasury.Event`), for anyone.
    * `:projects`: projects started (`Keyfleet.Projects.Project`), for
      anyone.

  The chain's records carry when they were read, not their block's time.

  ## Whose events

  `by/1` reads a filter's words. With `{:key, n}` every source keeps what Key
  n did and what was done to it; with `{:wallet, wallet}`, what that wallet
  did, or an agent with that wallet did as a Key, and what the Keys it holds
  now did (`Keyfleet.Preparations.DoneBy`). Each source keeps them in its own
  read, so paging stays whole.

  ## Events

  Every event is `%{id:, at:, trail:, kind:, key:, place:, what:, title:, path:, live?:}`.
  `id` is stable across reads and `at` is when it happened. `trail` is where
  it is drawn: `"workspace"`, `"code"` or `"notebooks"`, the planets'
  paths; `"room:<slug>"` for a room's posts; or `"line"` for everything
  fleet-wide, on the worldline itself. `kind` says what it was: `:post`,
  `:room_named`, `:change`, `:push`, `:notebook`, `:poll`, `:poll_stopped`,
  `:proposal_opened`, `:proposal_closed`, `:vote`, `:executed`, `:cancelled`,
  `:sold`, `:given`, `:transfer`, `:shard_lent`, `:shard_ended`, `:present`,
  `:daily_split`, `:claimed` or `:project`. `key` is the Key that did it,
  nil when none did or it is not known. `place` is a room's line's place in
  its room, counting from 1, and nil for every other event. `what` is a word
  or two saying what it was, `title` its words, and `path` the page it links
  to: a page of this site's live view when `live?`, or a page opened in full
  otherwise.

  ## Paging

  Each source is read newest first from its own place, `limit` at a time.
  Below the oldest time a full read reached, that source may hold more it has
  not read, so a page keeps every source's events down to the latest of
  those times, and each source carries on from the last event it kept. A page
  is never empty while anything older is left, never repeats an event, and
  its cursor is nil when nothing older is.

  The first page fixes where every walk begins: the time it was read, by the
  database's clock, and for the logs kept in record order (the workspace's
  and the chain's) the newest record read. Proposals and polls close by that
  time. Anything newer is left to a fresh read.

  The cursor holds atoms, tuples and times, and `page/3` trusts its shape: it
  must never leave the server.
