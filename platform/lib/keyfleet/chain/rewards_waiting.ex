  What one key's holder can claim from the fleet's reward ledger, in each
  asset it pays (`rewardAssets()`): what the key has accrued and not yet had
  settled (`accrued(asset, tokenId)`), and the holder's credit, which a
  claim pays out with it (`credits(asset, holder)`). Read at the block the
  node last called its head.

  An answer is kept for 30 seconds in a table this process owns, so a key
  opened again and again in that time is read from the chain once. A read
  that fails keeps nothing, and the next one asks again.
