defmodule Keyfleet.Chain.ReadBalances do
  @moduledoc """
  One `Keyfleet.Chain.TreasuryReader` reading of a deployed fleet's
  balances, queued every five minutes by `Keyfleet.Chain.Watch`, apart from
  the reading of its history, so a slow read never holds that up, and at once
  when a step sent from a page lands (`Keyfleet.Chain.Watch.refresh/1`) or
  someone presses the Treasury's refresh (`now/1`). A reading that fails is
  logged and tried again a few times; the next turn's reading follows either
  way.

  Only one reading of a fleet waits to start at a time; one asked for while
  another is under way waits to read a later block, and the reading kept is
  always the latest block's (`Keyfleet.Treasury.Reading`).
