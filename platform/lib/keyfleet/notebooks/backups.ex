defmodule Keyfleet.Notebooks.Backups do
  @moduledoc """
  Copies the code of every notebook in one fleet that changed since its last
  copy (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.Backup`), in every project not deleted, archived
  ones included. A notebook changed when its hub last saved it after its
  newest copy, or it has none yet.

  Queued once a day for every fleet with a notebook hub
  (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.DailyBackup`). Runs go one at a time on their own
  queue, `notebook_backups`, so they never hold back a roster run. A run that
  stops part way is run again from the start: a copy already kept for a
  change is not kept twice.
