defmodule Keyfleet.Keys.PresenceTimer do
  @moduledoc """
  Every hour (`config :keyfleet, Oban, cron:`): keeps present every Key whose
  shard the site's own timer wallet holds. An owner issues that wallet a shard
  with agent voting off, so it marks presence and nothing else.

  Once any of them has 24 hours or less left, it sends the same `present` step
  a person's Mark present button sends (`Keyfleet.WalletSteps.KeySteps`), which
  renews them all. It keeps no record of a send: each hour reads the chain again,
  so a send that never landed is sent again.

  Each of these is saved with the site's errors, and again every hour until it
  is fixed (`Keyfleet.Keys.PresenceTimerError`):

    * a send the node refused or didn't answer;
    * a Key with under 12 hours left, which means twelve runs have not renewed it;
    * under 0.0002 ETH in the wallet, about five days of marking 49 Keys;
    * a shard ending within 30 days, after which the timer can't mark that Key.
