  A count a page shows. `Ash.count/2` hands back its own errors, but a
  database that refuses the count raises `Postgrex.Error` or
  `DBConnection.ConnectionError` instead of answering (Ash 3.33.11). Both come
  back here as `{:error, failure}`, and are logged, so the page shows that it
  couldn't count rather than crashing.
