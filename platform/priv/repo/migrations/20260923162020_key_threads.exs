defmodule Keyfleet.Repo.Migrations.KeyThreads do
  @moduledoc """
  Gives every line in a room the key it was written as, and every key a thread
  of its own: a room of kind `key` at the address `key-N`, which no created
  room may take and whose name no other room's name clashes with. A thread's
  address is its key's, so the existing address index keeps a key to one
  thread and finds it; the fleet's own rooms get an index of their own.

  Generated with `mix ash.codegen`, then edited by hand so that the key check
  on lines is added without checking the lines already written, which can
  never be changed, and so that it cannot be undone (see `down/0`). The new
  address rule on created rooms is checked against the rooms already there,
  so a created room already at a key's address stops the migration rather
  than being changed.
