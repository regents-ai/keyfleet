defmodule Keyfleet.Atlas.Fill do
  @moduledoc """
  Every minute (`config :keyfleet, Oban, cron:`): counts into the Atlas the
  graph changes each fleet copied beyond where its cursor says the Atlas has
  counted (`counted_seq` of `Keyfleet.Graph.Cursor`). That is all of them for
  a workspace copied before the Atlas began, and none once the projector
  counts each page as it copies it (`Keyfleet.Atlas.Count.copied/4`).

  The changes are read from the copied events, never from the graph itself,
  2,000 at a time, oldest first. Each batch is one transaction that holds the
  fleet's cursor, as a page the projector copies does, counts the batch and
  moves the counted place past it, or to the end of the copied log once
  nothing is left. A run stops taking batches after 40 seconds and the next
  run carries on from there, so a year of history is counted over a few runs
  and no run outlasts its minute. Each batch tells the fleet's Atlas readers
  (`Keyfleet.Atlas.changed/1`).
