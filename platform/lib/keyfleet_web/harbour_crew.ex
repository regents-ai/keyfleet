defmodule KeyfleetWeb.HarbourCrew do
  @moduledoc """
  The ships on a harbour's sea: one for each of a fleet's most recently active
  holders, bound for the island of their newest action, and one for each
  holder whose Keys the fleet's agents here act as (`Keyfleet.Agents.Here`),
  which waits at the inn until it does something. A holder is a Regent
  account with every address it links, or an address no account links, as the
  Member List counts them: their Keys act together, and their ship shows the
  Key they write as. The inn is a chat, the forge is work in the workspace and
  the castle is a proposal or a vote. Sales, transfers and shards move no
  ship.

  The reader's own ship comes first, then those of the agents here, then the
  most recent, twenty-four at most. A ship keeps its ink on every sea, and
  carries its holder's address, how many of the fleet's Keys they hold, and
  their Keys' last few actions for its card. The sea behind the app's pages
  (`KeyfleetWeb.HarbourSeaLive`) draws them here from each fleet's activity
  and its agents here: as anyone reads them, from the readings every open page shares
  (`KeyfleetWeb.FleetNow`, `Keyfleet.Agents.Here`), or as a member reads them.
