defmodule Keyfleet.Notebooks.RunSource do
  @moduledoc """
  What a background run started through this site ran from, recorded when it
  started (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.Runs.start/5`): the sha256 of the notebook's
  saved code as Keyfleet read it just before asking for the run, and every
  file of the notebook then with its revision
  (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.Files.manifest/4`), so a result read later says which
  code and files made it and whether the notebook has changed since. A run
  started on the notebook host itself has none.

  The first record of a run stays: starting it again with the same
  idempotency key answers the same run, which ran from the same code.
