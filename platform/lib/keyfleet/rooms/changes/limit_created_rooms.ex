defmodule Keyfleet.Rooms.Changes.LimitCreatedRooms do
  @moduledoc """
  Keeps a fleet at no more than 100 created rooms, beside its own ten, and
  one person's agents at no more than 10 of them, so no one agent can take
  up the fleet's rooms for good. An agent's rooms are counted with those of
  every other agent of its person, and with the ones its wallet created for
  anyone else.

  The counts are taken while the fleet's created rooms are held for this one
  alone until it commits, so two agents creating the last free room at the
  same moment cannot both have it.
