defmodule KeyfleetWeb.AtlasPage do
  @moduledoc """
  A fleet's Atlas, read for its page (`KeyfleetWeb.AtlasLive`) and for its
  agents (`KeyfleetWeb.AgentTools.Workspace.Atlas`) from the three levels of
  `Keyfleet.Atlas`, as whoever reads it (`read_as`: `:actor` and `:context`,
  `Keyfleet.Access.context/3`), so only the fleet's members read anything.
  Every view of the page reads through here and nothing else.

  ## Windows and buckets

  A window is one calendar bucket of a span (`window/2`): a day, a week, a
  month or a year, in UTC. A window is read by buckets of a shorter span
  (`bucket/1` names the one the List and an agent use unless told).

  ## What each read answers

    * `rows/3`: the fleet's projects with any work counted, busiest first,
      each `%{project:, title:, changes:}`.
    * `swarm/6`: for each bucket of a span from `from` up to `to`, the
      changes, things and Keys of `Keyfleet.Atlas`'s swarm, of any `:source`
      and `:project`, split `:by` project or kind.
    * `totals/4` and `projects/4`: one window's changes, things changed and
      Keys at work, for the whole fleet and for each project.
    * `most_active/4` and `newest/4`: a page of one window's things
      (`thing()`), with `:after` for the page that follows, nil after the last.

  A thing's `path` is its own page: an item's page in the workspace, opened
  in place (`live?`), or the notebook itself on the fleet's notebook host.
