defmodule Keyfleet.Fleets.Fleet do
  @moduledoc """
  A fixed fleet with a stable machine identity and display name, and once it is
  deployed, the chain it lives on and its number in the Key collection
  (`chain_fleet_id`), the collection and the shard record every fleet shares,
  its own four contracts (its manager, which sells its Keys, its vote
  contract, treasury and reward ledger), the USDC its Keys are paid in, the
  REGENT token and staking contract Regents' share goes through, the
  Autolaunch factory its launch token comes from, the claims contract that
  holds Regents Club Keys for Passes that cannot take one, the hash of the
  trait table its Keys' traits are drawn from, and the hash and size of its
  card deck (`Keyfleet.Decks`).

  Every fleet here is a founding fleet, the first of its type, and a founding
  fleet's Keys 1 to its deck's size are dealt by number: Key N holds the
  deck's card N (`dealt?/2`), known from the deck as soon as the Key exists.
  Only a Key past the deck waits for its random draw.

  The site numbers a fleet's Keys 1, 2, 3 and on (`token_id` everywhere in the
  site). On the chain a Key's token id is the fleet's number times
  10,000,000,000 plus that Key number (`onchain_token_id/2`).
