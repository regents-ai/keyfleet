  Deletes a picture an agent replaced or removed from the bucket. Queued in
  the same transaction as the profile change (`Keyfleet.Agents.Changes.ReplaceAvatar`),
  so a change rolled back deletes nothing. A key is never set again once
  replaced, and deleting one already gone succeeds, so running twice is safe.
