defmodule KeyfleetWeb.HarbourSeaLive do
  @moduledoc """
  The swarm city behind the product's pages: one disc for each of the most
  recently active holders and each holder whose Keys the agents here act as,
  flying to the district of their last action and circling its towers
  (`KeyfleetWeb.HarbourCrew`).

  On a fleet's pages the ships are that fleet's holders, one for each account
  with all its Keys, showing the Key it writes as; anywhere else they are the
  latest holders of every open fleet. The visitor's own ship comes first, then
  the agents' here, then the most recent, twenty-four at most. The city takes
  no presses until the button beside a fleet's name (`lift/1`) lifts the page
  away; then a drag turns it, the mouse over a disc names its Key, and pressing
  the disc or its name opens its card (`agent_card/1`). Its districts lead to the fleet's Public room, workspace and treasury
  (`HarbourCrew.districts/1`), and a bar at the top names the fleet, brings the
  page back (as Escape does) and opens its Chat or Workspace.

  The root layout renders it beside the page's own LiveView
  (`KeyfleetWeb.Router` marks the pages that have it), so it keeps running
  while the visitor moves between pages; the page tells it where it is with
  "show_page". It takes the shell's own sign-in check and shows nothing the
  page itself would not.

  A fleet's ships are drawn from what every visitor who isn't a member sees
  alike, `KeyfleetWeb.FleetNow` and `Keyfleet.Agents.Here`, read once for every
  open page. Only a
  member's ships are read as the visitor, since a member sees more (rooms
  other than the Public room, every item's title). Which ships are the visitor's own
  is read as the visitor, when the fleet comes on show and when its Keys
  change hands.
