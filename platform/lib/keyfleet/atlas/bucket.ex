defmodule Keyfleet.Atlas.Bucket do
  @moduledoc """
  The fleet's work in one bucket of time (`Keyfleet.Atlas.Span`) for one
  project and one kind of thing: how many changes it took (`changes`), how
  many things changed (`things`) and the Keys that changed them (`keys`).

  Every change is counted into the bucket of every span that holds it, an
  hour, a day, a week, a month and a year, by `Keyfleet.Atlas.Count`, so a
  read of any span is a read of its own rows and never a sum: a thing changed
  in two hours of one day is one thing that day, and a Key at work all week is
  one Key that week. `Keyfleet.Atlas.Thing`'s `swarm` reads them
  (`Keyfleet.Atlas.Swarm`).
