defmodule Keyfleet.Proposals.Words do
  @moduledoc """
  A proposal's words, kept off the chain. The chain keeps only their
  fingerprint, the proposal's `content_hash`.

  The words are saved when someone proposes, before their wallet sends the
  proposal, so they are here when the chain reader records it. Writing them
  never waits on the transaction. Their fingerprint is worked out here from
  the words themselves, never taken from whoever sends them, so a fleet's
  words under a fingerprint are always the words that fingerprint names. A
  proposal is shown with the words its fleet saved under its `content_hash`,
  and with none when nobody saved them.

  The same words saved again keep the first save. Anyone may read them. A
  person may save them only so often (`Keyfleet.Proposals.Changes.LimitWords`).
