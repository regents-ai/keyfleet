  Starts a fleet's shared `understanding` project with one notebook, "Fleet
  understanding", unlocked, so every member edits it
  (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.Setting`): the place for the fleet's ideas about
  itself, soft rules, what annoys other members and tips that help.

  Queued once the project's space is recorded
  (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.Changes.QueueRoster`). The hub makes the notebook as
  this site's provisioner, tagged `keyfleet/fleet-understanding`: a run that
  made it and stopped before unlocking it finds it again by that tag, so a
  fleet never gets two. A hub that does not answer is waited for first
  (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.HubClient.wait_while_away/2`).
