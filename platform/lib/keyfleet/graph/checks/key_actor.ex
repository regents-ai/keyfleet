defmodule Keyfleet.Graph.Checks.KeyActor do
  @moduledoc """
  Who may write a fleet's workspace as one of its keys: the person or agent
  whose wallet owns that key today; an agent whose wallet owns none of the
  fleet's keys, when its person put it on that key and owns it today
  (`Keyfleet.Keys.AgentKey`) or when it holds an active shard of it; or an
  agent on none of the fleet's keys and holding no shard there that is paired
  with the person who owns the key today (`Keyfleet.Actors.Agent`'s
  `pairing`). A paired agent writes as its person's key, marked as its own:
  the stamp is the agent's, with its wallet.
  This is the rule rooms and direct messages use (`Keyfleet.Keys.identity/2`,
  `Keyfleet.Keys.agent_keys/3`).
  Nobody writes as a key whose edits a vote of the fleet has restricted, its
  owner included.

  A write names the key it acts as. Standing is read from that key every
  time, and only while the fleet's key ownership is fresh, so a key changing
  hands moves the right to write with it, ends its shards, and an unknown
  owner grants nothing.

  Every key adds to the whole fleet's workspace, whatever kind of fleet it is;
  which objects a key may change is the fleet's writer's to answer
  (`Keyfleet.Graph.Workspace`).
  The policy asks first; the fleet's writer asks again when the write's turn
  comes, and only that answer lets the write through.

  Each check has a budget in milliseconds, the graph's `:check_timeout`, and
  every read it makes gets what is left of it; once it is spent, the check
  reads nothing more and answers `CheckExpiredError`. A read that fails or runs
  out of time answers the error it got.
