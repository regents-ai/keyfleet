defmodule KeyfleetWeb.AgentTools.Keys do
  @moduledoc """
  Keys as an agent reads and keeps them: a Key as its page shows it
  (`show`), the Keys a wallet holds (`held`), taking a post off the wall of a Key it acts as (`wall_remove`),
  choosing the Key its person writes as (`post_as`), which of its person's
  agents is on which of their Keys (`agents`, `assign_agent`), its own mutes
  (`mutes`, `mute`, `unmute`) and its active shards (`shards`). Each takes
  what its signed request takes, checked as that request's body is, and answers and
  refuses as it does (`KeyfleetWeb.AgentTools.Run`,
  `KeyfleetWeb.AgentTools.Keys.Answer`). Only an agent runs them, never a
  connected app on its own; the Keys' own policies decide what it does.
