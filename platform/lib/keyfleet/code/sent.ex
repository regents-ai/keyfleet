  those its new tip reaches and no earlier tip of any branch reaches. Queued
  in the transaction that records the push (`Keyfleet.Code.record_pushes/4`),
  so every recorded push to a branch is followed up. Pushes only add, so
  the commits a push brought never change, and a run that fails part way is
  simply run again: a commit already recorded keeps the push that sent it
  first. A failed run tries again a minute later, up to `max_attempts` runs.
