  Deletes a deleted project's repository from the code store for good, then
  the site's record of it (`Keyfleet.Code.Repository`). Queued in the
  transaction that deletes the project (`Keyfleet.Projects.Changes.Forget`),
  once per repository. A repository the store never made has nothing to
  delete, and one already gone counts as deleted, so a run that fails part
  way is simply run again, a minute later, up to `max_attempts` runs.
