    * the record holds Classic #1 (type `classic`, set 1), whose deck ships in
      `priv/decks` with `keccak256` of its bytes the record's `deckHash`, made
      for `CLASSIC #1`, with the record's `deckSize` cards, drawing from the
      record's trait table, which ships in `priv/trait_tables`;
    * the site's Classic #1 is bound to that record's contracts, deck and
      trait table (`mix keyfleet.seed_deployment`);
    * Key 1's metadata names Set Type `Classic` and Set ID `001`, then every
      trait of the table in its order, and its card is published: kept on
      IPFS, and served as a card picture from the address its `image` names.

  `mix keyfleet.check_classic <deployed record>` runs it, after a Key is
  bought on a fork and the chain reader has recorded it, and again on Base
  once Key 1 has sold.
