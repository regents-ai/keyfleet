defmodule Keyfleet.Notebooks.Space do
  @moduledoc """
  Makes one project's space in its fleet's notebook hub: a hub project the
  provisioner owns, named after the project's title and tagged
  `keyfleet/<project name>`, kept on the project as `hub_project_id`.
  Recording it queues the fleet's roster run (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.Roster`),
  which makes every member an editor of the new space.

  Queued in the transaction that starts the project
  (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.Changes.MakeSpace`), and by a roster run for any of
  the fleet's projects still without a space, as when a fleet's hub is set up
  after its projects started. Runs go one at a time, behind roster runs, on
  the `notebook_hubs` queue, and one run per project waits at a time. A run
  that made the space and stopped before recording it finds the space again
  by its tag, so a project never gets two. A run still waiting when its
  project is deleted makes nothing. One whose project is deleted while it
  makes the space records nothing (`Keyfleet.Projects.Project`'s
  `record_space`), and its next try finds the project gone and stops. The
  delete run removes the space by its tag when it looks after the space was
  made. The one-run limit holds on each machine, so while two machines run,
  a delete run can look before the space is made and leave it on the hub.
