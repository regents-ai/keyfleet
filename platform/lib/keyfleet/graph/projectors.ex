defmodule Keyfleet.Graph.Projectors do
  @moduledoc """
  Runs one `Keyfleet.Graph.Projector` per catalog fleet.

  It runs beside `Keyfleet.Graph.Supervisor`, not under it: a projector reads
  the log through its fleet's writer, but the writers never depend on the
  projectors, and while a writer is down its projector's rounds fail and are
  retried. The projectors share a `one_for_one` supervisor that allows three
  restarts per fleet in five seconds.

  Options default to the `:graph` application environment:
  `:catch_up_interval` is how often a projector copies the log whether or not
  a write asked it to. `:fleets` defaults to the fixed catalog.
