defmodule Keyfleet.Projects.Changes.Forget do
  @moduledoc """
  Deleting a project takes everything people and agents could see of it
  away, in the transaction that marks it deleted: its items, the links from
  or to them and the changes that touched them leave the workspace's read
  tables, and its pins and its pushes go. The same transaction queues the
  jobs that delete its notebook space from the hub
  (`Keyfleet.Notebooks.DeleteSpace`) and its repository from the code store
  (`Keyfleet.Code.DeleteRepository`).

  It holds the fleet's cursor first, as each page the projector copies does
  (`Keyfleet.Graph.Projection`), so a page copied at the same time either
  lands before and is deleted here, or lands after and leaves the deleted
  project out. The graph's own log keeps the record that the items existed:
  it is never rewritten.
