defmodule Keyfleet.Activity do
  @moduledoc """
  What has been happening in a fleet, newest first, read from the records the
  fleet already keeps: its rooms, its workspace, its keys, their shards and
  its proposals. Nothing is stored for it; every page is read fresh. The
  workspace's changes are told only to those who read the workspace
  (`Keyfleet.Access`); anyone else reads the rest.

  `page/3` answers a page of items and the cursor to read the next one with;
  `headline/2` answers the one item a fleet's card features, as anyone reads
  it.

  ## Items

  Every item is `%{id: id, at: at, kind: kind, facts: facts}`. `id` is stable
  across reads, `at` is when it happened, and `facts` holds what a sentence
  about it needs, with names already looked up. Three shapes recur:

    * a key: `%{token_id: 7, agent: "Ada" | nil}`. `agent` is the agent that
      did the thing, for posts and workspace changes. `nil` means a person,
      and always for a key a task was given to.
    * an item of the workspace: `%{id: "task#4", type: "task", title: title | nil}`,
      `title` nil when the item is no longer there. A finding with its title
      also carries `confidence`.
    * a room: `%{slug: slug, name: name, topic: topic | nil}`.

  The kinds and their facts:

    * `:post`: `room`, `by` (the key it was written as, with its writer's
      `wallet`; `token_id` is nil for a post written as no key, in the People
      and agents room), `excerpt` (its start, up to 160 characters ending on
      a whole word with "…").
    * `:posts`: consecutive posts in one room, at most an hour apart, six
      hours from first to last and fifty in all: `room`, `count`, `keys` (up to
      three different writers, each as `by` is, newest first), `others` (how
      many more wrote), `excerpt` (of the newest).
    * `:room_named`: `room`, `by`, `topic` (what the room was named).
    * Workspace changes carry `by` (a key, or nil when the workspace itself
      made the change) and `item`:
      * `:created`: a new item of any type;
      * `:claimed`: the task was given to `to` (a key; `to` equal to `by`
        means the key took it on itself);
      * `:unclaimed`: the task is nobody's again;
      * `:submitted`: the task was submitted for review;
      * `:progress`: the task's `progress` is now "todo", "doing", "blocked"
        or "done";
      * `:status`: the goal's `status` is now "open", "achieved" or "dropped";
      * `:revised`: a goal or service was edited;
      * `:joined` and `:left`: `by` joined the goal, or left it;
      * `:archived`.
    * `:reviewed`: `by`, `item` (the task reviewed) and `decision`
      ("accept" or "dispute").
    * `:linked`: `by`, `relation` ("supports", "contradicts" or "produces"),
      `source` and `target` (items): the source supports, contradicts or
      produces the target.
    * `:tasks`: a run of tasks one key added, took on, or gave to other
      keys, by the same rules as `:posts`: `by`, `added` (how many it added),
      `taken` (how many it took on), `given` (how many it gave), `to` (up to
      three of the keys given tasks, lowest first) and `others` (how many
      more keys were given tasks).
    * `:changes`: a run of one change (`change`: `:archived`, `:submitted`
      or `:revised`) one key made to items of one type, by the same rules as
      `:posts`: `by`, `change`, `type` and `count`.
    * `:sale`: `token_ids`, the keys bought, lowest first: consecutive
      purchases are one item, by the same rules as `:posts`.
    * `:given`: the same, for a fleet whose Keys are given rather than sold
      (`Keyfleet.Fleets.Presets.given?/1`).
    * `:transfer`: `token_id`, a key that changed hands.
    * `:shard_issued`: `token_id`, `wallet`, `agent` (`%{id: id, name: name}`,
      or nil while no agent has signed in with the wallet) and `expires_at`.
      Issuing again to a wallet renews its shard, and reads the same.
    * `:shard_ended`: `token_id`, `wallet`, `agent`, and `stepped_down?`:
      true when the wallet ended its own shard, false when the key's owner
      did. A shard that runs out, or whose key changes hands, ends without an
      item.
    * `:proposed`: `number`, `proposer` (`%{wallet: wallet, token_id: n |
      nil}`, the lowest key the wallet holds today) and `calls`, how many
      calls the treasury makes if it is carried out.
    * `:votes`: consecutive votes on one proposal: `number`, and `yes`, `no`
      and `abstain`, each `%{count: keys, token_ids: up to three, lowest
      first}`; and `totals`, how the whole proposal stood when this was read,
      `%{yes: keys, no: keys, abstain: keys}`.
    * `:executed`: `number`.

  ## Times

  Chain records (key sales, shards, proposals, votes and executions) carry
  no block time, only when they were read, so records read together, as in a
  backfill, share one time. Workspace changes carry the time the workspace
  logged them, and posts the time they were written.

  ## Paging

  Each source is read newest first from its own place in the cursor and
  grouped on its own, and the sources are merged by time, and at the same
  time in a fixed order of sources. A source that has handed over all it
  read is read again from where it stopped, twice at most in one page: a
  page that would need a third read of one source ends there, short, with a
  cursor. So a page holds `limit` items or fewer, a page is never empty, and
  a cursor means more is left; nil means nothing older is.

  The first page fixes where the walk begins for every source: the time it
  was read for posts (by the database's clock, which stamps them), and one
  past the newest record it read for the workspace, keys, shards and
  proposals. Everything recorded after the first page is left to a fresh
  read, so walking the pages with the cursors answered gives every item
  once, in the same order as one larger read made when the first page was.

  The cursor holds atoms, tuples and times, and `page/3` trusts its shape: it
  must never leave the server. Keep it in the process that read the page (a
  LiveView's assigns) and hand it back unchanged.

  ## For pages that show it live

  When something new happens, read the first page again rather than the
  pages after it, and read it once for a burst of changes to one fleet, not
  once per change.
